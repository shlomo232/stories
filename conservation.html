    <h1>Conservation of Everything:  A New Natural Law</h1>
<p class=topnote>[The New Republic, October 28, 1978, pp. 10-11]</p>
<p>Not only coming events, but also coming ideas cast their shadows. For quite some time now a major idea has been trying to hatch, timidly, in intermittent bursts. It was met with skepticism, even with hostility at first. Its initial claims had to be proved in labs hundred times before being accepted. I am referring of course, to the idea of the finiteness of things, the concept that things like mass and energy and suchlike—physical things—exist in unchangeable quantities. They can neither be destroyed nor created. At best—or at worst—they can only be switch around, changed one into another and back again. This much has already become accepted after much effort.</p>
<p>But just as astrology and alchemy adumbrated astronomy and chemistry, the idea of the finitude of mass and energy adumbrated the much broader, all encompassing concept of the finitude of everything, including such immaterial intangibles as justice, pain, life-force, inspiration, integrity, and all the rest. And is high time that we face this idea in all its depressing magnitude, not only for its own glorious sake, but al to save ourselves much unneeded woe.</p>
<p>Let's consider justice first. Our century has been blessed with a rash of revolutions aiming at establishing a greater measure of justice on earth—in other words, increasing the quantity of justice extant. But dare anyone now, as we approach the close of the century, still maintain that this aim was ever approached, let alone accomplished? At best there was a redistribution of justice here and there. But increase? None. So why shouldn't we finally admit that there operates in this world a Law of Conservation of Justice, and stop making fumbling and bloody, attempts to create that which can no more be created than the amount of it which exists can be reduced?</p>
<p>I particularly chose justice for discussion first, because it is characterized by some unique traits which tend to mislead many into believing that something can be done about increasing its prevalence. These traits are quite interesting and I wish to point out a couple of them. For instance, justice seems to be characterized by something which can best be described as "clumping." It gathers in what amount to puddles, so that it is more prevalent in some parts of the globe than in others. A mere glance at the map will disclose this tendency, and it is not necessary to belabor the point. Obviously there is more justice in Minnesota than in Alabama, in England than in Zaire.</p>
<p>Justice likewise seems to respond to the magnetic attraction of the North Pole, and once again a glance at the map will prove this assertion. There is much justice in Canada; a little less in the U.S:, if this country is taken as a whole. And it keeps decreasing as one moves southward, until there is precious little of it at the southern tip of South America, where Chile and Argentina dispute ownership of some icy islands; and none at all in Antarctica. Not a single court of justice on that continent. Could this distribution be acciden­tal? Hardly. For the same pattern repeats itself elsewhere. Thus as one progresses from the Scandina­vian countries, where there exists almost a superabun­dance of justice, it diminishes as one moves toward the equator and beyond, until one reaches South Africa where there is virtually none at all.</p>
<p>Nor, as I said before, is justice alone in respect of being a fixed quantity. Take such a phenomenon as pain. We boast that we have largely conquered pain. From aspirin to novocaine we have developed pain­killers. But I question these claims. It is a delusion, I insist. Pain exists in the same amount as before, despite all the new medications and drugs. Of course, we do suffer less pain individually, but this is due to the enormous increase in the world's population. Obviously, if the same amount of pain that once served one billion people now has to serve almost four billion, we will each suffer less. But the total quantity of this commodity remains unchanged.</p>
<p>I had an argument on this score with a dentist friend of mine. Out of self-interest he naturally resisted my assumption and defended the wonders of his profes­sion in reducing pain. I challenged him: let all the dentists go on strike for one month, I said, and you will see that people all over will not suffer from toothaches any more than they do now. It was an impossible experiment, he said. Dentists are too individualistic to agree to such a test. And then it occurred to me that I could easily prove my point from another profession. After all, people also suffer pain from other causes—mental and emotional anguish, for instance. Then they go to psychiatrists. But by some strange quirk, all psychiatrists take their vacations at the same time, in August—the equivalent of a nationwide strike. Well, I gloated, have you heard of any epidemic of suicides or nervous breakdowns in August? And my friend had to admit that perhaps it was not pain-killers that helped sufferers from pain, but simply the lack of sufficient pain to allot to everyone as much of it as we used to enjoy in the past. Some masochistic sinners suffering from guilt even inflict pain on themselves, thus further reducing the supply available for all the rest of us.</p>
<p>The same principle of Conservation holds true for the life-force that animates all living things. True, the human population has vastly increased, and only the terror that the entire world may become one huge Bangladesh may halt the process. But on the other hand we hear of the drastic reduction of the whale population—blue whales, sperm whales, bottle-nosed whales, the whole lot. Has anyone stopped to calculate how many human beings weighing an average of 140 pounds can be endowed with life from the life-Force animating a single seventy-ton whale? And then there is the reduced fish population to consider (have you tried ordering a fish course in a restaurant lately?), and also many other species which have diminished greatly and are on the verge of extinction.</p>
<p>No, I will not go into the exact statistics of the matter. Any reasonably open-minded person will readily agree that the figures will check out.</p>
<p>Not wishing to tire the reader with what should now be obvious, I will mention only one additional phenomenon in life. I have in mind inspiration—the kind that produces highly talented persons and geniuses.</p>
<p>'Way back, some 25 centuries ago, when the human population of the earth was a small fraction of what it is now, geniuses abounded. Athens, a village by present-day standards, produced—need I list them?—Homer and Aristotle and Plato and Socrates and many playwrights, sculptors and mathematicians of genius. Jerusalem, a small hilltop town, produced one prophet after another. But how many prophets roam the streets among the millions of New Yorkers today? How many Aristotles grace New York's university campuses?</p>
<p>The cause is obvious. With so many people around, the brush of finite inspiration has to apply the paint of genius too thinly. As a consequence we have hordes of associate professors of philosophy but not a single Aristotle. And not a prophet in sight, though we have herds of Ph.Ds in sociology, theology, etc.</p>
<p>The Law of the Conservation of Everything stands clear and undeniable, after having knocked on the doors of our consciousness for the past couple of centuries.</p>
<p>It is a depressing idea, I admit. In fact, if after reading the foregoing paragraphs the reader still has appetite for dinner, he is probably endowed with more than his fair share of optimism—for optimism, too, exists as a sharply defined, finite quantity.</p>
