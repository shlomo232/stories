    <h1>The Tide</h1>
    <p>"This is a good spot," the man said to his wife as they approached the waterline.</p>
<p>"Yes, I guess this is all right. The sand won't blow."</p>
<p>They had been walking with their five-year-old son for some time looking for a suitable spot on the sand where they could spread their blanket and have lunch. The beach was crowded and they found no place until they came quite near the water-line.</p>
<p>The woman put down the basket of provisions and helped her husband spread the blanket. The boy gaily ran across the few feet of dry sand and then over the firmly packed wet sand to where a thin film of water was quickly receding, leaving bubbles in its wake and disclosing small holes in the firm surface. He stopped. In the distance a wall of water, huge, taller than he, was approaching. He watched it in fascination. It moved slowly at first, and then, when it noticed him, it moved faster and faster toward him. The top of the wave folded over and lurched toward him, break­ing with a loud crash. The boy was seized with terror. The wave broke and spread. It rushed in front of him and on his right and on his left trying to surround him. It slipped over the retreating ebb of the previous wave and was hardly slowed by it. When it reached the damp sand it gained speed. It rolled some clam shells toward him and dashed into a small ditch on his right moving far behind him.</p>
<p>The boy stood motionless, paralyzed with fear. Now it was coming closer. In a moment the water would reach him. But the wave stopped a few feet short, and leaving a twisting little ridge of sand and foam, it gently flowed back. But even as with relief he watched it retreat, another wall of water advanced in an unbroken front and his eyes fixed on it. It was bigger than the first wave and stretched in a straight line on either side as far as he could see. Then it began to curl inward from the right and from the left and the center too gained speed. The top of the wave turned a bright and evil green. It reached out for him with white foamy fingers, failed to grasp him and crashed into a rushing field of water to surround him. There was little left of the ebb of the previous wave and the sheet of water flowed unhindered toward him. His eyes fastened on the little ridge of sand and foam. Would this wave get as far? It was quite close now, and then with a final dash it brushed away the little ridge. Now it would get him. Now nothing could stop it. He fled in panic toward his parents screaming, "Mama!"</p>
<p>"What is it dear," his mother hardly turned to look at him. "Mama--the water," he stammered incoherently pointing in the direc­tion of a new approaching breaker.</p>
<p>"Yes, dear," she said. "There's a lot of water in the ocean, isn't there? Please open this can of sardines," she addressed her husband and proceeded to set out the paper plates.</p>
<p>Now the new breaker was coming in fast. It did not look as big as the one before, but the sound of its crashing was hollow and foreboding. Fearfully the child went toward it. Had it come as far as the one before? He looked at the sand. It had come almost two feet farther and had cov­ered some of the sand that was dry before.</p>
<p>Now he knew.</p>
<p>He went back mournfully. The lunch had been set out and his mother was putting some pieces of wrapping paper into the basket. His father was lighting a cigarette. The boy began whimpering: "Let's go, mama; let's go away."</p>
<p>"We can't go now. We're going to have lunch. Sit down."</p>
<p>But he remained standing and tugged at her skirt. "Let's go. I want to go."</p>
<p>"The child is overtired and hungry," she addressed no one in partic­ular. "Here, have a cup of milk. That will hold you."</p>
<p>"I don't want milk. I want to go," he began crying. "Let's all go." "Give him some cookies and make him stop crying," the father said irritably.</p>
<p>Still holding on to his mother and whimpering he looked about him­self. Thousands of people were on the beach, millions, billions. That was the biggest number he had heard of. And they didn't care. They lay on blankets and on the sand. Some of them stood in the surf ducking in the breakers. A few swam farther out. They were lucky. They could swim well. But all the others. Didn't they know?</p>
<p>There was the crash of still another wave. He didn't go to look how far it advanced. He knew. It would go a little farther, and the next one would go farther still, and then the whole beach would be covered with water and all the people and he and his parents too would all drown, except the ones who could swim well.</p>
<p>"Mama," he began wailing loudly.</p>
<p>"Yes dear, here is your milk," she offered him the filled cup of a thermos bottle.</p>
<p>"I don't want milk," he screamed in a frenzy. "I want to go: Let's go from here!"</p>
<p>"All right, then you will have it later," his mother turned away complacently.</p>
<p>The water would cover the entire beach and all the people, and his father and his mother and him too, and he couldn't swim. If they would go now they might save themselves. And then the water would come to the street and then it would flow into the subway tunnel and all the trains would be filled with water and those who started back early would be lucky and would get out of the subway before the cars were filled with water all the way to the ceilings. And then the water would flow into the streets and into the lobby of his house and into all the other houses.</p>
<p>For a second his attention was distracted. Far out on the water was a ship. It seemed to be standing still, only now and then as it plowed through a wave there was a flash of white foam near its bow. If he could get onto that ship or any ship--he would be saved. Ships were very big and many people could get on a ship. All the people on the beach could get on a ship and there would be room to spare. And a ship didn't care how big the waves were. If he could get his parents to leave at once they might have time to return to the city before they were engulfed by the waves and get onto a ship before the water rose from the lobby to the sec­ond floor and then to the third. His family lived on the fifth floor. It wouldn't take these big waves long to flood up to the fifth floor. It was very important to leave at once and to get on a ship.</p>
<p>"Mama, I want on a ship," he wailed.</p>
<p>His mother was eating a sardine sandwich. His father was silently gazing at the ocean.</p>
<p>"Yes, dear. It's very nice on a ship. Some day when you are older you'll go on a big ship. Do you want your milk now?"</p>
<p>"I want on a ship now," he whimpered. "I want on a ship now; let's go," he tugged at her.</p>
<p>Didn't they understand anything at all? Each crashing wave was com­ing closer. He didn't dare go to look how close the last wave had come. And soon the water would be all over them, and they refused to listen and to take him away. He began to cry hysterically and to stamp his feet in the sand.</p>
<p>"Stop it," his father said curtly. "You're too big a boy for this. You're getting sand over everything." And again he stared over the surging water, indifferent or ignorant of what it would do.</p>
<p>The boy sat down in despair. Now the waves would surely get him. He began crying softly. But even as his eyes were filmed with tears he saw it coming. It was a little muddy finger of water that curled between two small ridges of dry sand and slowly advanced. Its strength nearly spent, it licked its way forward until it reached the edge of the blanket and hid under it.</p>
<p>The boy jumped up and screamed, pointing at the wet spot where the water had been quickly swallowed by the sand.</p>
<p>"What is it?" his mother turned and threw her arms around him. "The waves: The waves!" was all he could say. His entire body trembled with terror.</p>
<p>"The blanket got wet," the father said in a tone of disgust and rose to move the blanket farther back.</p>
<p>"That's just a little bit of water," his mother tried to comfort the boy. "That's not a real wave. There now, don't you worry."</p>
<p>They moved the blanket a few feet back and sat down again.</p>
<p>"Now everything is all right. The water won't get this far," his mother reassured him.</p>
<p>His body shook with spasmodic sobs. That's what they thought. He knew better. The waves would come here too. They would cover the entire beach, and all the people. Then they would spread all over the city, and into the buildings, everywhere, and only on a ship one might be safe. But they wouldn't listen to him. They wouldn't listen.	</p>
