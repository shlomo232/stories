    <h1>The Failure of Compassion</h1>
<p class=topnote>"The Failure of Compassion" is a chapter from a novel in progress. Another part of this work—"Section Eight"—appeared in the Spring, 1956 issue of Midstream.</p>

<p>AFTER midnight Rose returned to Washington Square. Her clothes were disheveled and she staggered slightly as she walked. She came up from Sullivan Street, circled the fountain twice looking neither to right nor to left, walking as in a trance, intent on some great void within, then she turned along the northernmost path toward McDougal Street. As she neared the corner she noticed Jacob sitting alone and she slumped down on the bench beside him.</p>
<p>"Have a drink," he offered, tipsy.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"Where are the fellows?" he asked, and the question sounded more meaningful than he had intended it to be.</p>
<p>She did not answer, but the somnambulist blank expression on her face suddenly cracked and broke into a smile that instantaneously degenerated into a knowing, lewd smirk.</p>
<p>"You all alone," she said, defining the obvious.</p>
<p>"Well, yes," he hesitated, then looked at her closely. Her face looked worn, and her eyes were tired, but the swarthiness of her skin had a moonlit quality and the flesh on her face and neck and arms was soft and full and curving from some gentle inner pressure.</p>
<p>She became conscious of his stare and asked: "Where do you live now?" "On Twelfth Street. Come. Come with me," he blurted out.</p>
<p>She rose mechanically and followed him as he weaved uncertainly toward Eighth Street.</p>
<p>"I don't want to go there yet," she said as they reached Sixth Avenue. "Let's take a walk. Do you like living in a rooming house?"</p>
<p>He scarcely noticed the insipid question. His brain was in a whirl and the street swayed before him. What did pierce his mind was that she had said she didn't want to go to his room yet, and that meant for a while longer and foi a while only; but later, later, and she had also said something about rooming houses and this touched a tender spot, and provided an opportunity.</p>
<p>"I got an idea," he said, "a peculiar idea. Let me tell you about it," and gently he took her arm, but she disengaged it at once, not with anger or impatience, only with a slight nervous flick of the elbow. "You all got an idea, the same idea," she said and there was no bitterness or sneer in her voice. Again she was only stating a fact.</p>
<p>But Jacob did not notice the implications of her remark. "I got an idea and someday I would like to do something about it. About rooming houses. Well, you see, I have lived in many of them. They were all pretty much the same. Frizzly headed landladies, their hair always in curlers and pins and what-not, and all of them have little rheumy-eyed dogs called Queenie. But it's the tenants I am talking about, they are all the same too. Single people, mostly middle-aged, unmarried, lonely. And they never know each other. Sometimes they know each other's names. That's from the letters. The letters are left in the hall near a big mirror—there is always that life-sized mirror, so occasionally one notices a name. And let me tell you," he was waxing enthusiastic and warming up to the subject, momentarily oblivious of Rose at his side, "the things one can do with names, the images one can build up, the romances one can imagine, there is simply no end to them. There was that one time when someone named Prudence P. Pryor lived in the same house with me. I guess the P stood for Patience. That was a very long time ago and I was hardly more than a kid then. Well, I noticed the name on a letter and it stuck in my mind and I started imagining all sorts of things. Such a name, it sounded like an actress's name—no, I preferred to think she was a torch singer, though why a torch singer should live in that dump was more than I could figure out. I wanted to see her for a long time. I'd have to catch her picking up her mail, and she didn't get much. Once I noticed a letter for her and I sort of hung around the hall hoping she'd come down, but then the landlady got suspicious of my loafing in the hall and I beat it. Much later, just before I moved out of that house, I did see her, and maybe that's why I moved so soon after that—she wasn't anything to look at, a washed out sort of a person, the kind that waits on tables in cheap restaurants."</p>
<p>Rose paced alongside him, saying nothing.</p>
<p>"Then there was another time and there was a man and a woman in the room next to mine and they always quarreled, every single night. Jealousy, I guess. His voice, thick, base, would come booming, 'If I ever catch you again with that little runt I'll wring your goddamn neck,' and then her voice piping like a little girl's, 'But, John, that was my cousin, he just come in from out of town; honest it was my cousin.' And it was so false I could tell it was a lie right through that wall. 'Well, cousin or no cousin,' the man's voice would come again, 'if I ever catch you with your cousin again . . .' And so it was every night. Sometimes it was a cousin, sometimes a nephew. And I never did get to see either one of them."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THEY approached a bar on Sixth Avenue and mechanically turned inside and went into a booth. Rose got up and went to the women's room to straighten her disheveled clothes. Meantime Jacob ordered absent­mindedly, while his brain, already confused with drink, was trying to think two parallel thoughts. The "idea" that he began to unfold before Rose and that he hadn't completed occupied one part, even while the other part of his brain reveled in the thought of Rose. She was coming with him, to his room, had practically invited herself. It was now only a matter of minutes, or an hour or so at the most. Rose of Washington Square. The other fellows didn't matter. This was his hour. He'd tell her what he had thought about her. He'd tell her the name he had chosen for her. This was a night of wooing and of romance and of triumph and fulfillment, and he would make it more complete and more beautifully perfect than anything either had ever known.</p>
<p>Returning from the women's room Rose approached the booth, rocking before his glazed eyes, dividing in two then reuniting, a shy smile on her swarthy face, so innocent, experiencing his own trepidation, he thought. Whirling and circling slowly she moved yet did not seem to come any closer as he watched her, rapt and amazed at the miracle. He leaned against the wall and stared in disbelief. This is for me, it is a dance she is doing for me, he thought, and before he realized it she was again sitting across the table from him, her clothes now in order, the vacuous grin that was both lewd and innocent fluttering about her mouth and lending depth to her dimples.</p>
<p>Later, later, Jacob brushed the thoughts away.</p>
<p>"Do you know what name I picked for you tonight?" he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, you and your notions!"</p>
<p>"Before, when we were all sitting in the park, I thought of you as Mother Rachel."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Her voice was flat and distant. The grin continued its circular motion on her face.</p>
<p>Jacob didn't care. Now he was swept away by this idea. He leaned across the table toward her and spoke rapidly in a low voice, as if afraid of being overheard. "You know about Rachel, I mean Mother Rachel, don't you? Well, it's an old legend, that when the children of Israel were driven into exile by the Babylonians they passed Rachel's grave and they wept loudly and called on her, implored her to see their grief and help them, and Rachel heard, and, well, you know the line, a voice in Ramah, a voice of bitter crying, Rachel mourning for her sons. Well, tonight, in the park, earlier, when the others were there, that's how I thought of you, as Mother Rachel being kind to her exiled children."</p>
<p>Rose snickered and suddenly, without any reason that Jacob compre­hended, became angry. She put down her glass and declared primly: "Don't be a wise guy."</p>
<p>Slapped down, Jacob felt guilty without understanding why. He reached out over the table in a gesture of humility and contrition to take her hand. "I am not a wise guy," he declared solemnly. Had she asked him he would have gotten down on his knees and proclaimed before all the people in the bar that he was not a wise guy. But her face lost its momentary anger and resumed its placidity. Feeling forgiven, he proceeded to develop his idea, goaded by an urgency to explain, to erase all suspicion from her mind that he had meant anything wrong or coarse or indecent. "You see what I mean," he whispered hotly. "They are all exiles, all of them, the boys in the park. Never mind their manners and their talk and all the rest of that. They are exiles just the same, exiles from their homes and exiles from their people and exiles from their time, and a lot of us, I mean them, sometimes affect all sorts of crudities for self-protection."</p>
<p>The idea slowly sifted through her smooth skin and then through the muscles and finally into her brain. By the time it got there she shaped it into pellets of words that rolled off her shapely lips: "You mean fugitives from the Bronx? Hah, hah, hah!" And she laughed, not loudly but insidiously and it seemed to Jacob that she winked when she said this.</p>
<p>"No, no, not fugitives, exiles. There is a difference."</p>
<p>"Go on, emote some more," she teased.</p>
<p>Her remark brought him to a halt.</p>
<p>The waiter picked up their glasses, refilled them and discreetly shuffled off.</p>
<p>Jacob stared moodily into his glass, then looked up at Rose and resumed the thread of the "idea" as if there had been no interruption.</p>
<p>"So, about the rooming houses, as I was saying, I have a plan and someday I will do something about it. My plan is this. Make a party for all the people in the house. Pick the biggest room and invite them all there. Introduce everybody and then of course drinks and all that. But the point is, you see, they should all get to know each other and then they will love one another and will become like a big family and then the house will be a home instead of a rooming house. And just think of all the things that can happen. All these people who were no more than names on letters on the mantelpiece under the big mirror will become real living people. There will no longer be any mystery about them, but instead there will be such gladness and friendliness and they will all say, Why didn't we do it before? Why did we live in darkness and isolation and estrangement? And some of them will fall in love with each other, and there will be weddings in the house and all will attend. And even the landlady will take out her curlers from her hair and take off her eternal dirty kimono and put on a dress and she will look human, and Queenie will look washed and her eyes will no longer be rheumy. Even Queenie might be rejuvenated and have a love affair," he concluded on a note of levity.</p>
<p>"But even if it shouldn't work out like this, if it should all be confined to the one evening only, it would still be worthwhile, one grand binge of friendship and gaiety and life. And the next morning everything could return to the usual routine. But, you see, it really could never be the same again."</p>
<p>He stopped rather lamely and looked to Rose for approval. She said nothing. "What do you think of the plan?" he asked. She only snickered in reply.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HE GULPED down his drink and tossed a handful of change on the table. One coin teetered on the edge and fell to the floor. "Come," he ordered moodily and Rose mechanically followed him outside. They walked up the Avenue without saying a word then turned to the left on Twelfth Street as by agreement. The windows in the four-story brownstone house were dark. He fumbled for the key, opened the door and they went in and up to his room on the third floor. He switched on the light. The bed was neatly made. In the corner, near the window, was a table with a typewriter and scattered sheets of paper. A dresser and two chairs completed the furnishings. Self-consciously Jacob stood not knowing what to do. Rose watched him remotely. He quickly went up to the window and pulled down the shade but the privacy thus gained did not reassure him. There were things to be said and done first, to make it all right, as it should be. Hospitality, he had to act the host, she was his visitor, his guest, his . . . He leaped to the dresser and took a nearly full bottle out of one of the drawers, poured some into two glasses and handed her one. She took it nonchalantly and sat down on the bed. Jacob remained standing.</p>
<p>"Is this where you are going to have the party?"</p>
<p>He was becoming more self-conscious by the second. Now was the great moment. It was necessary for him to say the word, to take the first step. But his head swam and in his brain there was a buzz of no no no, careful, careful now, gently, gently, tenderly, do not be abrupt, do not be rough. At this moment he loved her with a great passion and compas­sion, and so he remained standing not knowing what to do. She did not seem to care one way or the other. She held her glass without drinking from it, looked at him with a permanent wave of a smile on her comely features, then said, merely to say something, "What kind of things do you write?"</p>
<p>"Oh, ridiculous, grotesque things," he seized the opening her question offered him.</p>
<p>"Heh, heh, heh," she tittered and waved her hand flirtatiously. "Oh, you! Like for instance?"</p>
<p>He perked up. The doors of communication were open again. "Well, there is a story I am writing now," he said with animation and sat down on the edge of the bed near her but leaped up again when it seemed to him that she shrank away almost imperceptibly. "It's a story about a man who is very much in love with a woman, but she is, well, she is a bitch. So she says, the man who is going to marry me must make one hundred and fifty dollars a week. But he only makes one hundred and ten dollars a week. So he is despondent for a while, then he decides to try for it, for the one hundred and fifty I mean, because he loves her so. Will you at least see me once in a while until I get to make that much, he begs her, and she says, yes. What does she care? So he applies himself to his job. He takes special evening courses and he works overtime. He even tells his boss about the woman and the condition she made. His boss is a nice guy and tells him that he will give him a ten-dollar raise every six months if he proves he deserves it. Well, the months go by. Every few weeks he calls up the woman he loves and begs to see her, and sometimes she consents and sometimes she tells him to go to hell. He is consumed with jealousy and is fearful that she well meet some man who already makes one hundred and fifty a week, or even more, and then his chance would be lost forever. But the jealousy and the fear only goad him on to work harder. So at the end of one year he makes one hundred and thirty dollars a week and at the end of eighteen months he makes one hundred and forty dollars a week and he is ever so careful to keep his job record unblemished and not to hurt his chances of promotion. Thus two and a half years pass. He had turned lean because he ate little trying to save for after his marriage to the woman he loved, and his hair had become noticeably grey. But he paid no attention to these things, he was so absorbed in his great project. Each time he saw the woman he would ask her to reassure him that she would stick to her promise, and she would do so, though it seemed to him that sometimes she was peevish about it and annoyed with his persistence. Finally the great day came when his boss called him into his office and said to him, 'John, you have done very well. You are the best man we have in the firm. Beginning this week I am giving you another ten-dollar raise, this will bring it up to a hundred and fifty a week. Isn't that what you have been working for?'</p>
<p>"And John was so happy and grateful and excited that he scarcely knew what to say. That same afternoon, as soon as he finished his work, he called the woman and told her the great news and she said he should come to see her Friday evening, the day he would get his first full one-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pay envelope.</p>
<p>"He was so excited that his work suffered somewhat that week. But this in itself would have done no harm. Something much worse happened. In the firm where he worked all the employees had to sign-in to work each day, and for every tardiness, even one of a couple of minutes, there was a deduction. John had never been late to work before, but this week, perhaps due to his excitement which prevented his sleeping properly at night, he was late once. Dreading the consequences of his tardiness he tried to talk to the bookkeeper about it, but the bookkeeper said there was nothing he could do, that if he was caught changing a time card he would be discharged. He tried to talk to the boss, but he refused to be bothered with such trifles. John even tried to appeal to the girls working in the office, hoping that they could somehow help him, though he knew that this was useless. Day followed day, then Friday morning came, and then Friday afternoon and the checks were distributed. There it was, a check for one hundred forty-nine dollars and seventy cents. He rushed to the nearest telephone to call the woman he loved. He told her what had happened and she became angry and ordered him not to call on her that evening. He begged and pleaded with her to keep the date with him, then he begged that she see him the following week when he would come with a check for a full one hundred and fifty dollars and they could plan their marriage as she had all along promised him. But the woman became angry and said he had had his chance and now she never wanted to see him again. 'You promised,' he implored. 'You had your chance,' she retorted. 'Is it another man?' he pleaded. But she only slammed the telephone receiver down.</p>
<p>"Dazed with grief and frustration John went out of the telephone booth, not knowing what to do. Should he take the money and give it to the first panhandler he met? Of what use was it to him now that she refused ever to see him again? Or should he perhaps change it to nickels, 2994 of them, and scatter them one every few feet? But he didn't want to leave a trail since he didn't care where he was going and wasn't concerned about getting back. All sorts of mad and useless plans ran through his mind but not one of them would serve any useful purpose, his purpose, and so, not knowing what to do he sat down on the curb and wept. And many people went by and felt great pity for him, and not knowing what troubled him, some of them tried to put coins in his hand."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JACOB finished and sat down on the bed. "Rose," he whispered, "Mother Rachel." Softly, so softly his fingers barely touched her skin, he caressed the smoothness of her bare arm.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" she asked, her body immobile, indifferent, but a trace of a whine in her voice.</p>
<p>"Rose, Mother Rachel," he repeated, but the arc his fingers described on the fullness of her arm became shorter until his hand came to rest altogether.</p>
<p>"Why do you keep calling me Mother Rachel?" she asked peevishly. "That makes it incestuous."</p>
<p>Stung, he sharply withdrew his hand and got up.</p>
<p>"You are a queer duck," she said seeing his bewilderment. She moved over to one side of the bed and made room for him. "Sit down, take a load off your mind."</p>
<p>He sat down primly on the edge of the bed. "Now," raced through his head. "Now is the time!" He turned toward her, one arm outstretched in readiness for the embrace, but it stopped midway, halted by the cold indifference on her face. Slowly his arm descended and came to rest on her dress over her thigh and there it remained for a moment, awaiting the least sign of encouragement, but receiving none retreated in defeat.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you another," he began lamely, anxious to break the tense silence.</p>
<p>"Another what?" she turned toward him.</p>
<p>"Another one of my stories, which I write. You wanted to hear about them."</p>
<p>Rose relaxed from her sitting position and stretched out on the bed. Her hands beneath her head, her eyes fixed in a stare on the ceiling lamp, she unexpectedly said: "Would you state, after careful consideration, that women are people?"</p>
<p>"That women? Are people?" Jacob repeated after her. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Just that. I heard a fellow ask that earlier this evening."</p>
<p>"One of the fellows? The ones you went with?" Jacob asked.</p>
<p>Whatever had prompted her remark slipped from her mind and she did not answer his question. Instead she sat up and asked him to pour her another drink. He leaped up, glad to do her bidding, glad also to get away from the meaningless dilemma of her question. He handed her her drink and also poured another for himself, feeling somehow strangely encouraged and ready to resume his pursuit of her inert body and remote and inaccessible mind.</p>
<p>Rose downed her drink in one gulp and put the glass on the floor. She too seemed to revive and looked at Jacob teasingly, a gleam in her dark eyes.</p>
<p>This time he pulled up a chair to the bed and sat on it unsteadily. "Rose," he began without looking at her, "I want to ask you some­thing."</p>
<p>"First give me another drink," she said, and her mood seemed to change suddenly. Jacob hastened to fill her order. But she did not drink from the glass and only stared into it pensively.</p>
<p>"Yes? What's on your mind, rebel," she finally said, the harshness of her words belying the melancholy of her expression.</p>
<p>"About tonight, I mean earlier," he articulated with difficulty because of the subject that troubled him as well as because of the amount of liquor he had taken. "When you went with the other fellows . . ."</p>
<p>"Jealous, lover?" she persisted in her new tone, and when Jacob did not answer she said with more softness, "Don't be jealous."</p>
<p>"I am not jealous," he alibied.</p>
<p>"Can it, lover; you're not jealous, you only want to know. Sure you want to know. So now listen carefully and I'll tell you what happened."</p>
<p>Confronted with the certainty of knowing, Jacob was fearful and tried to divert her from telling, but his unclear protestations were unconvincing, and Rose's mood of melancholy changed and gave way to vindictiveness. "I'll tell you," she insisted. "You want to know, so I'll tell you. You got to know."</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to pry into your personal affairs," he pleaded. "What I had in mind to ask . . . you misunderstood . . . it was about something else . . . I mean . . ."</p>
<p>But Rose did not listen to him. Holding her glass in her outstretched hand, she leaned back and rested her head on the bulge of the pillow and stared at the ceiling. "So what happened is this," she began softly again as if oblivious of Jacob's presence. "You might say nothing happened, but that wouldn't be right either, so I guess something happened after all when I went with the boys, even though nothing really happened the way you mean it. And we all went up to what's his name's place, I forget his name at the moment—guess I had too many drinks. And for a while the boys talked about all kinds of things and they poked fun at David and his hallucinations of a pogrom in New York, and about your resignation from the League and somebody said that a party ought to be sent out to find you and that it was your holiday so you ought to provide the enter­tainment, and so on, and it was all phony and. I could see they were all tense about me and they were sorry there were so many of them, and glad too because each one by himself would have been even worse off not knowing what to do, and this went on for half an hour maybe, and this one brushed by me, and another put his hand on my head for a moment, and one even dared put his arm around my waist and pretended to be drunker than he was and let it slip lower and lower, daring and not daring and hoping the others didn't notice it and hoping that they did too, and only David didn't talk and didn't pay any attention to me, I guess because he still has that pogrom on Second Avenue on his mind. And I had compassion on them, so I said, 'Boys, would you like to see me naked?' And they were so stunned that they didn't even answer, only David still in a trance muttered something about a Jewish girl being stripped naked on the Avenue and chased by that gang from Yorkville. I went into the other room and undressed, for, I thought, they are all hungry for me, and they probably had never seen a naked woman close by, so why shouldn't I do this thing for them? But I went into the other room to undress, s'funny"—her tongue briefly failed to articulate clearly—"s'funny why I did that." And she stopped and raised her head from the pillow and sipped twice from the glass. Now she sat up and gazed at Jacob soberly. "I really don't know why I went into the other room to undress. Then I came into the room where the boys were and I stopped in the middle for a moment and then I walked by in front of each of them and I turned around and they gasped and stared. And one fearfully touched my nipple, and another put the flat of his hand against my belly, and pulled it back as if he had burned himself," she said with a laugh, "and one raised both his hands as if to ward me off and moaned in disbelief, but only David spoke when I stopped before him, and he said, 'Yes, this is the girl the gang from Yorkville stripped and chased into an alley off Second Avenue and then raped her to death.' "</p>
<p>Tears welled up in Jacob's eyes, but Rose was composed.</p>
<p>"Why do you cry, because you weren't there? You resigned. Remember?" "I wasn't there," was all Jacob said.</p>
<p>"You didn't miss much," Rose said casually. "I bet you're anxious to know what happened after."</p>
<p>"I wasn't there," Jacob repeated his cry of loss.</p>
<p>"Guess what happened? You're anxious to know what happened? Aren't you? I bet you think that the moment I stepped out they rushed after me, that they seized upon me, that they didn't permit me to put my clothes on, that they raped me, that there was an orgy? Don't worry. Nothing happened. You didn't miss much, I told you. I got dressed and came back, and they were still sitting there stunned, and I was the one who had to cheer 'em up. And then they chatted for a while and we broke up.</p>
<p>"G'wan," she concluded, "you men of spirit. You are a lot . . .</p>
<p>"Please pull up the windowshade; it's awfully stuffy here," she added for­mally and Jacob went heavy-hearted to do so, seeing both her request and her last disparaging remark, which he took to include himself, as the final ruination of his high hopes for her visit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SINCE the situation had taken such a turn, he tried to be a good sport about it even though the apparent finality of the disappointment caused him intense physical pain in the lower region of his chest and in his groin. He refilled their glasses and handed Rose hers with a pained gesture of chivalry, but he retreated to the open window where he leaned on the sill.</p>
<p>"We men of spirit, we are a lot," he repeated one of her last phrases. "But, Rose, let me tell you something."</p>
<p>"Shoot," she challenged him with a seductive smile which in his bitterness he disregarded.</p>
<p>"I want to tell you a story, a kind of a parable, you might say," he said and sat down on the chair which he ostentatiously and resentfully removed a couple of feet from the bed.</p>
<p>"I love parables," Rose muttered, demurely sipping from her glass. "I have a passion for parables, so g'wan, let's have a parable."</p>
<p>Jacob pointedly ignored her sally. The evening was lost, obviously, but he would have his say; it was terribly important that he have his say.</p>
<p>"It's this way," he began with mock pomposity. "It's this way. So here is a young fellow, let's say he's about eighteen years old, and let's say for argument's sake that his name is John."</p>
<p>"What an original name for the hero of a parable," Rose said.</p>
<p>"He's not a hero," Jacob said mournfully.</p>
<p>"The central character of the story, then," Rose corrected herself.</p>
<p>"Rosie," Jacob threatened her with his index finger, trying to enter into her new mood and just barely seeing hope sprout that perhaps if the tone of the conversation were to be switched to such a playful track something of his hopes might still be retrieved, "I said a parable, not a story."</p>
<p>"Three cheers for parables, and down with stories." Rose raised her glass in a toast then emptied it and almost fell onto the bed.</p>
<p>"So there is this boy John, and he is madly in love with a girl . ." "Named Jean," Rose anticipated him. "Jean, Jean, come have a bean," she recited, suddenly very drunk.</p>
<p>"Yes Jean," Jacob bitterly consented. "That's right. This is the formula—John who is eighteen and pure of heart is madly in love with Jean who is seventeen and is likewise . . ."</p>
<p>"Pure in heart and thought," Rose finished the sentence for him. "And then what happened? Tell me, you're a writer of parables, you should know, does anything ever happen, I mean really happen?"</p>
<p>"Never mind about the happenings. That's philosophy. I'm trying to tell you a parable, please listen. What happened is this: that John swears to Jean eternal fealty and loyalty, and his readiness to give his life for her, and oh, if only he had the chance to demonstrate his love, and if only he could give his life for Jean thus gaining one tender look of admiration from her as he lay gasping his last breath at her feet."</p>
<p>"What did the little bitch say?" Rose interjected. "Couldn't she give the poor kid a tumble?"</p>
<p>"What did Jean say? She didn't say anything! How could she?"</p>
<p>"What's the matter? Was Jeannie deaf and dumb? What a girl to fall in love with."</p>
<p>"Give me a chance and I'll explain it all to you," Jacob said, bowing toward Rose. "Jeannie, as you call her, was in full possession of all her faculties including those of hearing and speech. And John was a nice boy of normal and healthy inclinations who would only fall in love with an equally sound girl. If Jeannie didn't respond with words to John's oaths of love, passion, tenderness and affection, it was for the very simple and obvious and inevitable reason that John was a normal boy and all these oaths were of course uttered only in his mind for when he spoke to Jean he was too secretive about his great and sacred passion, and he spoke to her only of such matters as good boys speak of to good girls."</p>
<p>"You mean he talked to her about the revolution and the labor theory of value! I know," Rose said.</p>
<p>"Rose," Jacob protested. "I am in the midst of telling you a great parable that contains within itself the seeds of such a truth that future generations, when they ponder it, will only marvel at its profundity, and who knows, they might even mark this evening when I am composing this fable for your benefit as an international holiday. They might even change the calendar and begin counting the years from tonight. And you? What do you do? You jeer, that's what you do! And, let me assure you, it is most unseemly. I will therefore replenish our glass containers with the amber liquid that befuddles minds and brings forth inspiration. So, where was I? Yes. It was in his mind that John made these great promises, and that, you will admit, has many advantages, for it makes us noble and at the same time it also provides an avenue of escape, since no one but their progenitor knows of these proud vows. At the same time I wish to reassure you that John was indeed a good boy and was not merely playing both sides against the middle. But he nevertheless managed in one form or another to make Jean aware of the strength of his feelings for her, and great was his joy when she showed delicate indications of responding to his sentiments, and though she displayed little ardor at this stage and merely invited John to come to visit her at her house to listen to a radio play with her, she vaguely hinted that both her parents would be away at that time . . ."</p>
<p>"Just like I thought, a little slut," Rose declared emphatically.</p>
<p>"You do the maiden wrong," Jacob corrected her. "She was not a slut either big or little, and indeed, the rumors current about her in her senior high school class were that she was still quite virginal and belonged to the limited company of those in her class who could claim this dubious but terrifying distinction, and furthermore, by casting such unfounded aspersions upon the young lady you not only injure her reputation but likewise raise doubts about the character of John who was not a young man to troth his heart to a slut, either big or little, and also you must realize that for the sake of our parable . . ."</p>
<p>"Your parable."</p>
<p>"For the sake of our parable it is essential that the ingredients that go into it be of sterling quality. And now that we have agreed on that much, I hope you will no longer continue to inject the earthy female element, which is your element and which I dearly love but which nevertheless tends strongly to give a strange flavor to a legend of a different stripe, and we can proceed. And so it came about that as John approached the house wherein Jean lived, and it was a fine house of two stories . . ."</p>
<p>"Male and female?"</p>
<p>"A fine house of two stories and constructed out of brick of a pale yellowish color so that it showed that fine people lived in it, and likewise it had a couple of trees suitably situated and a fair-sized lawn in front . . ."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't you say this adds up to a pretty consistent picture of a petty bourgeois establishment in a state of decline?" Rose wanted to know.</p>
<p>"No," Jacob interrupted his legend, "I would definitely not say anything of the sort. For one thing we must admit on the basis of evidence that the petty bourgeoisie, in this country at least, is not in a state of decline, and secondly, this house whereof I speak, had you but listened carefully you would have realized, shows signs of a kind of stability and basic soundness and health that do not go with decline, and . . ."</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah?" Rose jeered. "And what would you call this, the folks go away and leave Jeannie all by herself, free to hold orgies, or, God forbid, to be raped by a masked bandit."</p>
<p>"Fear not, fear not," Jacob reassured her in the same bantering yet terribly serious tone, "Jeannie was not the type of girl to hold orgies in the absence of her parents for, as I have said before, she was a young maiden pure in heart and unsullied by . . ."</p>
<p>"Strikes me like a pretty dull sort of girl, and furthermore, about her parents, where did they go? Did they go separately or together? Didn't her old man perchance go to meet some cute little number he had on the side, and maybe the old woman too? Now this is very important to establish. Don't tell me they just took off to see a movie?"</p>
<p>"Well now," Jacob said soberly, as if the possibility propounded by Rose suddenly presented him with a serious problem, which he previously overlooked, "well now, this is an important question, but, would you believe it, it hadn't occurred to me to introduce it into the legend."</p>
<p>"I brought up the possibility. Would you now say that women are people?"</p>
<p>"I never doubted that," Jacob bowed to Rose formally. "I never doubted that for even an instant. But now let us return to the story, or the parable. On second thought the parents are really not too important in this case. Let them go their ways together or separate as pleases them, while we return to our young people. So there was John proceeding to the house of Jean, his heart full of love and his brain all awhirl—I think that's how they used to say it. And as his pure heart thumped louder with each step, he soon came within sight of the house and he looked even at the house lovingly knowing what it contained . . ."</p>
<p>"What did it contain?"</p>
<p>"Jeannie, that's what it contained, you know that."</p>
<p>"Oh, excuse me, I thought maybe he loved the house because it con­tained commodities, you know what I mean."</p>
<p>"And he already felt the tip of his finger tingling . . ."</p>
<p>"Look," Rose interjected, "this boy of yours is too quick on the trigger. Couldn't he keep his hands to himself for a little while at least?"</p>
<p>"You misunderstand," Jacob lowered his voice almost to a whisper, "his finger was tingling with anticipation of a sort different from the one that automatically comes to your materialistic mind. He simply visualized himself pressing his finger to the doorbell and Jeannie smiling as she heard the bell ring and knowing that it was he."</p>
<p>"Oh," Rose said, "ex-cu-se me please. I misunderstood. So when is the wedding?"</p>
<p>"There won't be a wedding," Jacob said mournfully.</p>
<p>"No wedding!" Rose exclaimed and sat up. "How come? Who is the foul scoundrel who stands in the way of the union of two young souls?" "There is no scoundrel."</p>
<p>"In that case I am lost," Rose admitted in mock despair.</p>
<p>"For it happened in this wise, that as John approached the gate he saw a big and vicious-looking police dog crouching on the lawn."</p>
<p>"Right near the steps too, I bet," Rose added her bit.</p>
<p>"In your feminine way you have grasped the situation perfectly," Jacob complimented her. "The big vicious dog crouched right near the steps. And this I forgot to tell you before, because it wasn't necessary then, that John dreaded dogs. In the perfection of his character there was this one little blemish, to offset in a way his otherwise perfect young manhood. And now he stared in bewilderment at the predicament whose outlines he began to perceive but whose total import was yet to unroll before him. The dilemma, as you see, was of the simplest yet most basic nature—What to do when the thing one can do is out of the question for one reason and the thing one wants to do is out of the question for another reason."</p>
<p>"I got the answer, I know the answer," Rose almost shouted gleefully and raised her hand as a child would in class. "You got the thesis, you got the antithesis, the answer is the synthesis. Three cheers for Hegel and the dialectic," and she fell back on the bed.</p>
<p>Jacob looked at her in bewilderment. Rosie and the dialectic. So all these years, at the meetings, Rose was not just a figure of dark beauty; she had also learned something. But why her irony? Why her jeering?</p>
<p>Severely he asked her, "And what, pray, is the dialectical answer to this situation?"</p>
<p>"Let John fall in love with the dog," Rose suggested.</p>
<p>"Let me remind you of the historical situation as it actually existed</p>
<p>in this parable. John was already in love and his date was with Jean." "You make a temporary alliance with the enemy," Rose suggested. "Out of the question," Jacob ruled in all seriousness.</p>
<p>'"You are rigid in your interpretation to the point of sectarianism." "And you," Jacob said, "show distinct tendencies of deviationism."</p>
<p>"So what is your answer?" Rose asked.</p>
<p>"I have no answer," Jacob admitted. "I am not supposed to have any answers. I was merely telling you a parable, though a significant one, to be sure, if you will please recall."</p>
<p>"OK," Rose demurely consented, "on with the parable."</p>
<p>"John didn't know what to do. He walked past the house a little way hoping that this impediment to the fulfillment of his hopes would somehow vanish, or run away . ."</p>
<p>"Or be distracted by some canine Jeannie?" Rose resumed her bantering tone.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter what," Jacob said somberly. "John walked past the house a little way and turned back realizing that the situation, in any case, was not as simple as it had seemed before."</p>
<p>"I see our boy is growing up," Rose said.</p>
<p>Jacob ignored her. "But as he approached the gate once more and slowed down his steps, the vicious dog was still there and this time alert to the suspicious character who retraced his steps."</p>
<p>"All characters who retrace their steps are suspicious," Rose said with finality.</p>
<p>"Everybody retraces his steps, sooner or later," Jacob corrected her. "And so, torn between desire and fear, our young friend John paced back and forth. And at one point he stopped at the fence and. started calling softly: 'Nice doggie, nice doggie, come here,' but the dog only snarled in response. John was becoming desperate, for the time of his calling on Jean had already passed by some minutes yet he could not muster enough courage to risk the long white fangs. It occurred to him that he call to Jean and that she would hear him and come out and fetch him inside, but the thought of such a possibility caused a chill to run down his back. What of his readiness to give his life for Jean if necessary?</p>
<p>"Thus John worried and wondered and grew ever more anxious, and he hoped that without his calling to her, Jean would look out of the window to see whether he was approaching and notice his predicament and come to his rescue uncalled. But this did not happen and the window shades in the house remained as they were—white and starched and unmoved.</p>
<p>"Quickly John ran off to a nearby business street and entering a butcher shop he ordered some pounds of beef and bones which he carried back to Jean's house. He threw a piece of meat across the fence. At first the dog growled, but he did go up to examine the offering and gulped it down. John threw him several more pieces of meat and bones which the dog took as a matter of right, but whenever John started to open the gate, the dog would stop eating and growl menacingly so that John re­treated."</p>
<p>"What happened when the meat gave out?" Rose asked with seeming indifference though she was obviously deeply interested.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Jacob asked mechanically. "That's just it. Didn't we say before that nothing really happens? I don't know what happened."</p>
<p>"So what did lover boy John do when he couldn't get by the big vicious dog of which he was mortally afraid to meet Jean with whom he was equally mortally in love?"</p>
<p>"Now you're talking, when you ask what did he do. Though I don't really know what he did. Rumor has it that in final desperation, though without giving up hope completely, he simply sat down near the gate and began tearing the buttons off his clothes."</p>
<p>"That was a smart thing to do, wasn't it?" Rose asked.</p>
<p>"Smart? What has that to do with the matter?"</p>
<p>"And did he finally give up all hope?" Rose wanted to know.</p>
<p>"Obviously not, because in that case there would be no point to the parable."</p>
<p>"Is he sitting there still?"</p>
<p>"It is quite possible."</p>
<p>"Poor Jeannie," Rose said compassionately.</p>
<p>"This is the parable," Jacob said, exhausted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THEY now sat silently for a while, Rose reclining on the bed, her eyes I closed, and Jacob staring fixedly at the floor. All passion and all hope and all desire were drained out of him. Time had come to a standstill and though far in the recesses of his mind he felt something stirring, it was too remote to be distinct and on the conscious level there was only a faint buzz like a weak radio signal. How much time passed in this way he did not know, but suddenly Rose stirred and the spell was broken.</p>
<p>"Jacob," she called to him softly.</p>
<p>He turned to her silently, a look of intense grief in his eyes.</p>
<p>"You're still jealous, about the other fellows, before," she said almost tenderly, and when he only lowered his eyes she reassured him, "Don't be jealous. It's you I like."</p>
<p>Jacob looked at her with young bitterness. "Don't mock me," he said firmly.</p>
<p>"I am not mocking you," she said, her voice still soft. "That too was a kind of parable."</p>
<p>"I was not in it," he said with bitterness in his voice.</p>
<p>"You didn't have to be in it. I like you," she said simply.</p>
<p>He leaped up from his chair and rushed toward her. He put his arm around her shoulders and drew her toward himself looking intently into her face. For a second or two she yielded to the pressure of his embracing arm, then suddenly she grew rigid and convulsively pushed him away. "No," she said in a voice trembling with anger.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," he quickly apologized and withdrew his arm. They were silent a while, then Rose broke the tenseness. "Let's have another drink," she said wearily, and heavily moving his legs in uncomprehended defeat Jacob almost shuffled to do her bidding. They sipped the drinks slowly and in silence.</p>
<p>"Why are you angry with me?" Jacob finally asked in a monotone, not daring to look at her face.</p>
<p>"I am not angry," she replied irritably.</p>
<p>"You said you liked me."</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>Jacob shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"I'm tired," she said.</p>
<p>"Rest," he answered, though not without a note of anguished tenderness.</p>
<p>Rose finished her drink and stretched out on the bed. "And you will entertain me?" she said coyly again. "You can tell me some more." And she giggled uncontrollably. "Shoot."</p>
<p>"OK," he consented, as if he had been asked to recite a lesson. "There are quite a number. Is there any particular kind you'd like to hear? About old women or young girls? About old men or young boys?"</p>
<p>"I'll listen to anything you will tell."</p>
<p>"And then?"</p>
<p>"And then I will know."</p>
<p>"And you will say—what?"</p>
<p>He waited for her answer, and when she said nothing, he seemed to brace himself against a slight shudder that convulsed his body, and as if commanded by an authority not to be denied, he prepared to obey.</p>
<p>"And then there was the old lady with her book of trading stamps," he began and looked at Rose, but she lay motionless on the bed, her eyes were closed and she showed no sign of having heard. Jacob wondered whether the liquor had not overcome her, but quickly turned his eyes away and sitting rigidly on his chair, staring fixedly into space before him, almost in a posture of military attention, he continued with his tale, painfully anxious not to miss a detail or to leave an incident un­explained. He might have been a young lecturer delivering his maiden lecture at a great university under the scrutiny of the authorities and a large audience.</p>
<p>"And so there was this old lady with her book of trading stamps," he began again. "Trading stamps are little green stamps that are given by some large stores as a bonus to customers, one for every unit of purchase. One accumulates them and pastes them into a special little book that is given free to the customers. When the book is filled one can turn it in at certain predetermined stations and then one receives as a free gift some useful household appliance. Should one be diligent in accumulating these stamps and patient in cashing them in, it is possible to amass many books of such stamps and to receive proportionately greater gifts. This is called postponement of immediate pleasure for more satisfying and greater reward later on."</p>
<p>Jacob stopped to moisten his lips. He easily slipped into his new role and for a fleeting instant his eyes roved to right and to left as if he were looking for the customary glass of water on the speaker's dais. Having caught his breath, and without looking at Rose who still lay inert and seemingly asleep, he continued:</p>
<p>"For these stamps are like good deeds which one performs and for which there is reward later on, and naturally, these deeds are performed at a cost. In the present case, for instance, the cost to oneself is not inconsiderable. For one thing, the store which issues the stamps probably charges considerably more than other stores in the neighborhood, and even when they don't charge more, there are other ways in which one pays an extra price for obtaining them. For instance, a friendly neigh­boring storekeeper, who does not dispense such stamps, may be bypassed in order to acquire them. In this manner his feelings are hurt, his livelihood is impaired, and there is the sense of guilt acquired for wronging him. But within the arithmetic of the situation there is a logic, for if one were to deny oneself all other present pleasures and work hard and spend all one's income in stores that dispense these stamps of future reward, one could lay up a great store of future benefit, for the time when it would count most, since the present is but a fleeting instant and anything lavished on it is wasted. It may be argued, indeed, that it might be wiser not to spend any money at all, or nearly at all, and to put it away in a mattress or an old stocking, and that in this manner one would, in the end, have more than through accumulating stamps. Arithmetically this would be correct, but in truth this would be a false reckoning, for only deeds count and there is no merit in non-doing. The non-doer is not a factor either in the present or in the future, and in the process of doing, one does, to be sure, waste some substance, but the reward laid up for the future, if the action is praiseworthy, far exceeds in value the substance that has been wasted in the doing.</p>
<p>"And now that we have the introductory remarks, we can proceed to the body of the story. There was this old lady with her book of trading stamps. This was not, of course, her first book, for during her long life she had filled many books and cashed them in. But now that she was getting very old her needs were few, and furthermore, she felt her end nearing and she was most anxious to complete this last book before she died. This was becoming increasingly difficult to do. In addition to her diminishing wants, she was becoming feebler and found it ever more difficult to walk as far as the nearest store that gave these future-benefit stamps. On a number of occasions she asked the boy who lived next door to do her shopping for her, and he was a good boy and gladly ran errands for her; but he was still very young and scatterbrained about matters that were big in the eyes of his elders, and so it happened more than once that, although he had been reminded to do so, he forgot to ask for the future-benefit stamps, or having taken them he lost them on the way back, to the great disappointment of the old lady.</p>
<p>"Thus a long time passed until there came a day when the old lady felt that she was about to die. She could no longer get out of her bed, but with an effort she pulled open the drawer of the dresser that stood near her bed and withdrew the stamp book. Lovingly and with trembling hands she turned the pages one after another, pages full and brimming with the green color of her good deeds. The early pages had the stamps pasted on in fairly even rows. In the second half of the book, the rows were not nearly so even for her hands had by that time become quite shaky, but each page had its alloted and required number of stamps. Thus she turned the pages until she came to the last one which was full down to the last line and the last line was full down to the last space, and the last space was empty.</p>
<p>"And when she beheld the last empty rectangle, and she knew that her end was near and that she would never have an opportunity to complete her life's work, tears came into her lusterless old eyes and the tears rolled down on the empty space and spread in the pulpy paper of the page. After a short time she put the book down, and grasping the cane which rested against her bed, because she had been in need of it for many months before, she tapped with it against the wall to the neighboring apartment where lived the boy who ran errands for her. He came in and she said to him, 'Sonny, I think this is my last day,' and when he showed signs of being frightened she reassured him and said, 'Go and fetch me the priest who lives around the corner.' The boy ran to do her bidding and in a short time the priest came.</p>
<p>"'Mother,' the priest said as soon as the boy went out. 'You are going to your eternal reward. Grieve not. You should feel happy.'</p>
<p>"The old lady did not answer at first and only handed the priest the book of green stamps that was full throughout, except for the last space.</p>
<p>The priest was an intelligent man and he soon perceived what was troubling the old woman. 'Grieve not,' he said again. 'Your life's work is completed.' " 'And what will I do with this?' the old woman's colorless lips whispered. " 'It might be a good idea to give this book to some deserving but needy person who may get the benefit of it,' the priest said.</p>
<p>" 'Years of my life have gone into accumulating these,' the old woman said. 'If only I could complete it I would gladly go to my eternal rest. Is there no way of beseeching and persuading the Lord to prolong my life just enough for me to complete my work?' the old woman asked.</p>
<p>" 'I know of no way,' the priest said kindly, 'but it really does not matter. If you give this book of works to another person, the merit of this deed will far outweigh everything else, and you should feel happy knowing that you have given to another the efforts you have made during such a long time.'</p>
<p>" 'Father,' the old woman mumbled indistinctly, 'it's not stinginess on my part if I refuse to do so, and also I would not mind giving away this book. I know that I cannot take any material possessions with me. But if only it were complete I would gladly depart this world. As it is I will go unfulfilled and when I come to the blessed eternity I will grieve, silly woman that I am, that I did not finish my work.'</p>
<p>"Seeing her despair, and realizing that her moments of life were rapidly ebbing away, the priest, who was a kind as well as an intelligent man, said to her, 'Let me run an errand for you. Give me some money and I will run down to the store and buy something for you and get the missing stamp so that your book of green deeds should be filled completely.' "The old woman pointed to her pocketbook and the priest fumbled in it for some money. Though he found none, he told the old woman that he had found some and ran outside to fill her last precious wish. It took him only a few minutes to run to the store and back again clutching some random purchase and several stamps. But when he entered the old lady's room, he found her dead, the uncompleted book of her deeds clutched between her bony fingers."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JACOB stopped and looked toward Rose for the first time since he began telling his story. Her eyes were wide open and she stared at the ceiling. He patiently waited for some comment.</p>
<p>"This is just another boy-girl-dog story," she finally said severely without looking at him.</p>
<p>"In a way," he reluctantly admitted.</p>
<p>"Don't you know any other kind?"</p>
<p>"I know many stories, but I guess when you get down to it they are all boy-girl-dog stories. Do they bore you?"</p>
<p>"No. Do you know any others of this kind?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Tell me two more, only two, for I'm tired."</p>
<p>"I think I'd better stop altogether," Jacob said.</p>
<p>"No. You must tell me two more, and then . . ."</p>
<p>"And then?" Jacob wondered.</p>
<p>But Rose did not say what she had in mind and merely repeated im­periously: "Tell me two more."</p>
<p>"Well," Jacob began, and resuming his stance of impersonal narrator he fixed his eyes on the opposite wall, "there was this boy of, say, eleven . . ." "No autobiography, please," Rose interjected impatiently.</p>
<p>"No autobiography," Jacob agreed without looking at her. "So there was this boy of about eleven and he was an overprotected child."</p>
<p>"I don't want child psychology either," Rose again interrupted him almost angrily, but Jacob was deep within himself and did not visibly react to her mood as he had earlier in the evening.</p>
<p>"No, no child psychology," he said tonelessly, "I don't know child psychology, and I am not especially interested in it. This boy's mother overprotected him not for reasons of child psychology but because he was her only child and she loved him very much. She was not a very sensible woman, for she imagined all kinds of dire mishaps befalling her child, though she was sensible enough to let him go about his usual boy's activities such as going to school and the like, but no sooner was he out of her sight than she would begin imagining that he had been struck by a car and lay bleeding and screaming on the pavement. She was still more obsessed with the idea that her boy might be persecuted and taunted or even beaten by other tougher children and that he could not defend himself adequately to preserve his boyish sense of self-respect and basic dignity. For she knew that she had brought up her boy to do what is right and to shun evil, especially violence, whereas other boys had not been so brought up, and since she could not herself cope with evil she knew that her son could not either, and when confronted with evil violence he would remain defenseless and he would cry in his heart, or even out loud, for succor, yet who would come to his aid if she was not there? And for this reason—at least this was one of the reasons—she always thought of ways to make her son strong in body—for she already believed that he was sound in soul—and she worried lest he did not eat enough, and then how could he be as strong as the other boys in whom there was evil and violence?</p>
<p>"This troubled her very much and she kept thinking of it almost constantly—that is whenever she was not overcome with terror lest he had been severely injured.</p>
<p>"Finally a simple idea occurred to her, yet for some time she did not act on it. She realized that, if put into practice, it might make life difficult for her son among his classmates. But as the weeks passed the idea gained hold on her to such an extent that she knew she would have to do it. The idea, as I said before, was very simple. Knowing that her son needed strength and likewise knowing that she loved him above anything else, she decided that she would daily bring him his lunch to school. But not simply a lunch—that he was in the habit of taking with him every day. There is nothing so nourishing for a growing boy, she said to herself, as a good hot soup. Of course, he could buy this in the school cafeteria, or in some café around the corner from the school. But who could tell whether he would do so, and would the soup be as well prepared and as nourishing as the one she would lovingly make for him? And what if, distracted by other matters, he would only taste a spoonful or two and leave the rest?</p>
<p>"Thus she worried and wondered and finally decided that on the following Monday she would start to bring a bowl of hot soup to her son in school. What would the other children say? Wouldn't they sneer at him and call him mamma's pet and similar nicknames that make a boy's life miserable? The mother was aware of this but decided to ignore it. What did the other boys matter? Who cared what they said or did? Her son had to be nourished and made strong.</p>
<p>"Her decision waxed within her, and the following Monday, without saying a word about it to her son, she prepared a hot rich soup and when twelve o'clock neared, she filled a bowl, and covering it with a napkin she went toward the school, which was not far off. One or two acquaintances who passed her on the way inquired what she was carrying, and when she briefly told them, excusing herself that she had no time to talk at length, they nodded their heads in amazement.</p>
<p>"The mother came into the school at the time the classes were dismissed for lunch and she stood quietly near the wall as the boys wildly tumbled out of their classrooms. The boys did not at first pay any attention to the woman with the bowl, and she hugged the wall so that they should not in their eager rush upset the bowl. Then her son came out of his classroom. Though not as exuberant as the other boys, he too was gay and had a flash of excitement in his eyes. When he saw his mother he was perplexed for an instant, but ran up to her, a question in his eyes.</p>
<p>" 'Come, my child,' she said to him tenderly, 'show me where you boys eat your lunch.'</p>
<p>" 'Mother, what have you got in the bowl?' he asked curiously.</p>
<p>" 'Your lunch, my child. I brought you a hot lunch. You have to grow up big and strong. I prepared it myself,' she said and removed the napkin from the still steaming soup.</p>
<p>"By this time a group of boys had stopped to watch what was going on and they began nudging each other knowingly and whispering meaningfully while pointing at the mother and her son.</p>
<p>" 'But, Mother, I always bring my lunch with me," the boy began to protest, aware that he had been put in a ridiculous situation before the other boys.</p>
<p>" 'Yes, I know,' the mother said completely oblivious of the circle of childish faces that now surrounded them and gleefully watched the proceed­ings. 'But I finally realized that what you used to take with you for lunch, or bought here, wasn't enough.'</p>
<p>" 'But, all the other boys do so,' her son exclaimed in anguish, suddenly realizing that he was being deprived of something precious.</p>
<p>" 'Yes, my child,' she said gently. 'I know all the other boys do so, but you are not like all the other boys, and I love you more than any mother ever loved her son, and you must grow up to be strong. Come,' she said changing the subject, 'show me where it is you eat before the food gets cold.'</p>
<p>"The boy looked about and saw the sneers and the snickers on the faces of his classmates. For an instant his face contorted with rage and pain and in a hissing whisper he said to his mother, `Go away, Mother; go back home. Take this with you. I don't want it.'</p>
<p>" 'Come,' the mother ignored his desperate plea, 'come, don't pay any attention to the other boys. Come and eat your lunch before it gets cold.'</p>
<p>" 'I will not! I will not!' the boy screamed in anger. 'Go away, Mother; go away!' And not fully comprehending what he was saying he added in a low voice, 'What are you doing to me, Mother!'</p>
<p>"The other boys meanwhile gleefully jeered, 'Look at him, look at the baby! Mamma brought him a hot lunch. Hey somebody, bring a bib! Can I have some of it? Or is it all for him?'</p>
<p>"One of the boys actually stuck his finger into the still hot soup and disregarding the mild scald it gave him, licked his finger and pronounced, `Delicious! Try it fellows!'</p>
<p>" 'It is getting cold, the soup is getting cold,' the mother fretted. 'I made it extra rich today, for you, and you refuse to eat it.'</p>
<p>"Boy and mother now stood facing each other. The mother kept repeating, 'It is getting cold, it is getting cold,' while the son, now also indifferent to the jeering of his classmates, begged silently but with tears of anger and pity in his eyes, 'Go away, Mother; go away!' "</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jacob came to a stop, but this time he did not even turn to look at Rose. She was alert though and as soon as she realized that he had finished his tale she asked, "And what happened? Did she go away with her soup?"</p>
<p>"I suppose it is only right," Jacob answered without looking at Rose. "If I seem to keep on telling the same story, why shouldn't you ask the same question. Again you ask what happened—in this case, what did the mother do. I don't know what she did. The story does not tell. Perhaps she did go home, perhaps she didn't. She might even have understood the meaning of her act when she brought the soup to school. But the answers to these questions are part of a different story."</p>
<p>"And do you know any stories of this different kind?" Rose asked.</p>
<p>"Not tonight," Jacob admitted.</p>
<p>"Oh," was all Rose said, but she did not get up and continued staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p>"Oh, well," she added a moment later in a cheerful tone that rang strangely in the atmosphere of mournfulness that pervaded the room. "You still owe me one last one, positively the last, so make it good," she said and burst into laughter.</p>
<p>"One last one, and then . . . It was you who said 'and then'," Jacob reminded her.</p>
<p>"Tell me the last story," was all Rose said in reply.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"THIS is the story of a fine and gracious lady," Jacob began solemnly, "a very fine and gracious lady indeed whom life passed by, and at the time this little event which I am about to relate to you took place, this lady whom we will call Dolores, was nearing her fiftieth birthday. Naturally, in all these years much had happened and even more had not happened to Dolores. Otherwise she would not have become what she now was, a fine and sad and gracious lady. But we will not go into the details of Dolores' life now since it would take us too far afield and would take too long to tell. It will suffice to mention a few important details such as that Dolores, though nearing fifty, as I said above, was still and apparently permanently unmarried, that her once blue-black hair was now heavily streaked with grey, that her figure was beginning to show distinct signs of heaviness. Also, she was quite poor; in fact she was only a salesgirl in a women's apparel shop where she was in charge of the brassiere counter. How it came about that such a fine and talented woman—for she was a fine woman and quite talented in her younger years—should remain in such a lowly position we will not now discuss; perhaps it was the will of God. What should be noted at this time is that some ten years before the incident to be related, Dolores underwent a severe mental and emotional crisis that convulsed her entire being and of which she later recalled but one symptom: that she was obsessed and tormented by one phrase which she felt compelled to cry out all the time. This was: I am the end. This no doubt had to do with the fact that she was unmarried and childless, and with the realization that she would remain so all her life. But she managed somehow to pass that crisis, and though this phrase reverberated through her mind for about a year, she never did cry it out, and no one knew its secret. When the year of her crisis passed, Dolores calmed down and became contentedly resigned to her lot. Her former ambitions were almost forgotten and she applied herself to living a sane and sensible life. It was then that she got her job at the brassiere counter in the women's apparel shop. She also decided to make her life comfortable in many other little ways, such as moving into a small but cozy apartment which she furnished economically and in good taste. For a time Dolores also enrolled in a number of evening classes. Then she took drawing courses for beginners. At one time she had also planned to take up music instruc­tion, but this was too expensive, and her musical needs were at this stage easily stilled through ownership of a reasonably good radio and occasional attendance at concerts.</p>
<p>"But Dolores had an interest in the fine things in life, and even more than this she had a love of people, of fine people who graciously speak to each other in courteous manner. It was the company of such people that Dolores wanted for in this manner she could overcome her loneliness and participate in the life about her. Being a woman nearing fifty who had never known a man, she feared men and sought only the company of women.</p>
<p>"Through her habit of reading the neighborhood newspaper regularly and carefully, Dolores learned of the existence of the West Tenth Street Women's Current Events Club, and after some months of following its activities, it became her great ambition to become a member of this club. The names of members of the club who were cited in the weekly report of neighborhood activities sounded dignified and aristocratic, and on the few occasions when addresses of members were given, Dolores knew them to be stately brick structures dating back to the past century in which she believed only culture and good taste and fine manners prevailed.</p>
<p>"Dolores did not know how to gain admission to such a select yet desired society and having always been shy, and being shyer yet at this time of her retirement into herself, she could only dream of some lucky accident that would make this possible. She dared not hope that such an accident would really happen, and because she dared not hope, it did happen in the simplest and most common manner. For one day two dignified and stately matrons entered the store where Dolores worked and they came to her counter to make some purchase, and from their conversation she recognized them as members of the West Tenth Street Women's Current Events Club, and she flushed with a rush of courage and asked them to confirm the fact. This the ladies graciously did, flattered at being recognized, but when Dolores, her courage now ebbing fast, asked them how one could become a member, they at first looked at each other in dismay, considering the impossibility of the request, then they looked at each other again and at Dolores and once more at one another, and the same idea occurred to both of them that it would be a grand and unusual gesture on their part if they were to recommend the acceptance to membership of this woman who in every way did not belong to their circle. And so they took Dolores' name and address and promised to invite her to the following meeting of the Club at which her membership would be considered.</p>
<p>"Dolores was happy, and when she received her invitation she was un­bearably excited. What should she wear for the first meeting? Should she buy new clothes? It might be too obvious and not in good taste. But her own clothes were not nearly as good as the ones the two women had worn. She pondered the matter long and could not make up her mind so that at the last moment she wore whatever happened to be at hand and trembling with anticipation she rang the bell of the house where the meeting was held. It was a beautiful old house and the hostess and her family occupied the entire second floor. The meeting was held in the spacious parlor that over­looked the tree-lined street. It was furnished not lavishly but in excellent taste, and as the two dozen or so ladies, mostly in their late fifties and early sixties unself-consciously moved about talking to each other in small groups before the meeting opened, Dolores sat to one side, the object of considerable curiosity, fearing to stir lest she disturb the charm of the afternoon.</p>
<p>"To her surprise Dolores was accepted as a member of the Club and she felt proud and fulfilled and she was only concerned lest she fail to live up to the high standards of culture and courtesy and grace which prevailed in this group of well-to-do women. She took a keen interest in the particular events that interested them, though out of shyness she usually abstained from active participation in their discussions. When the group once under­took a charitable project for underprivileged children in the neighborhood, Dolores rashly contributed two weeks of her salary and this sum, so large in her meager budget, passed unnoticed by the others.</p>
<p>"Almost a year passed before the main event of this story happened. For it should be noted that the meetings were held every two weeks in rotation in the home of a different member, and since there were about twenty-five members in the Club, all this time passed before it was Dolores' turn to serve as hostess. But she became keenly aware of the problem many weeks in advance and it troubled her deeply. Where would she entertain in fitting style her friends who were so far above her? Her small apartment could not contain them, and its shabbiness as compared to the fine parlors where the Club members always met ruled it out.</p>
<p>"At the last meeting before it was Dolores' turn to serve as hostess, the members of the Club showed in their usual delicate fashion that they were aware of her predicament. When announcing the place of the following meeting, they casually passed over Dolores, and they did it so tactfully that had she not protested no one would have noticed it. But feeling her slight keenly, and seeing this as a denial of the genuineness of her belonging to the Club, Dolores arose and took the floor and said: 'No, dear ladies, this may not be, for if indeed I am to be a proud and full-fledged member of this fine society as I believe myself to be, then I must not be passed over, and I wish to assure you that I will provide accommodations fitting enough, though not equal of course to the gracious homes in which we have so far met.'</p>
<p>"Thus spoke Dolores in stately words, speaking her own mind yet using the barely remembered graces of language which she had imbibed in her girlhood from books nearly four decades before. Her remarks caused con­sternation in the group, and some looked at each other in amazement, since they were confronted with a situation with which they did not know how to cope, and others spoke gently to Dolores, saying, 'My dear, this is completely unnecessary. We are quite aware that you do not have the facilities, and it really does not matter at all, not at all, for you are our favorite member and we would not under any circumstances inconvenience you.' And all of them naturally regretted the lapse of judgment which made them accept Dolores into their group where she obviously did not belong, and some thought quite bluntly that sympathy should not be carried too far, while others merely nodded their heads in mild dismay.</p>
<p>"But Dolores insisted gently but firmly on her right to provide the accommodations for the meeting and to do her duty as hostess. Thus, having no choice left, all the women in the group agreed, wondering what would come of it. 'If it is not in your small apartment, where then will we meet?' one of the women cautiously asked. But Dolores assured them that they would all be informed by mail in ample time.</p>
<p>"Dolores made her decision. The very next day she took out a large part of her small savings and went to the most expensive hotel in the city and asked to rent its large Blue and Gold Room seating two hundred for the afternoon of the meeting. The manager of the hotel was at first dubious and asked many questions about the character of the group and the nature of its discussions. When these were explained to him, he was more at ease for he recognized some of the names of its members as being highly respectable. He could not understand Dolores' role in the proceedings, thinking at first that she was merely a messenger of the group who had been sent to make the reservations. When Dolores explained that it was indeed her own project, he again had serious doubts, but seeing that she was ready to pay in advance, he merely shrugged his shoulders and agreed to the transaction. Dolores, however, insisted that at four in the afternoon, after the cultural part of the meeting was over, her guests must be served a lavish assortment of delicacies. For this the sum of money she had brought was far from sufficient. She therefore paid what money she had brought and on the following day she withdrew the remainder of her savings and brought them to the hotel. She then found a small printing shop nearby which undertook for a reasonable sum to print elegant invitations and these she mailed to all the members of the West Tenth Street Women's Current Events Club.</p>
<p>"When the invitations were received by the members of the Club, there was much consternation. Some refused to believe their eyes and telephoned the hotel for verification. When there no longer remained any doubt that Dolores had made fantastic reservations at the most expensive hotel in the city, there was much telephoning back and forth between the mem­bers. 'We cannot permit this,' one said, and, 'The poor girl is out of her mind,' said another. 'It is too lavish; it is in poor taste,' said a third. 'I will not go there,' several said, 'this is a bad joke and I will not be a party to it.' But Dolores was radiantly happy at the arrangement she had made, and when one of the members called her and said, 'You poor girl, you shouldn't have done this. You must have used up everything you had. Please let me ask my husband to cancel the arrangements—he knows someone in the hotel management,' Dolores replied in courtly style, 'This you must not do, dear friend, for it makes me happy to have done what I did, and after all the lavish hospitality I have enjoyed this past year, and the pleasure and the honor of the distinguished company of all the members, it is but a little thing I am doing and far from what I owe to all of you.'</p>
<p>"On the day of the meeting Dolores came early to the Blue and Gold Room to make sure that all was in order, so early in fact that the management at first refused her permission to go in, claiming that the huge room was being readied after an earlier function in the morning. When the door was finally opened to her promptly at two o'clock—for she had rented the room for the hours between two and six—she found everything in excellent order, yet she passed carefully from one chair to another and from table to table, touching one here and one there to make sure that everything was in perfect order, and she was most happy.</p>
<p>"But it was not till after three that any of the members arrived, and by half-past three there were only ten of them and no more came; and they felt terribly ill at ease, and looked at each other meaningfully while Dolores rushed from one to the other in great excitement urging one to be seated and asking another whether she was comfortable, and exclaiming eagerly, 'Isn't this nice?' and 'Isn't this all right?' She was assured many times that it was all very nice indeed and most unexpected, but there was no talk of going through the usual routine of a Club meeting and a few minutes before four some of the guests began looking nervously at their watches, and Dolores became panicky and begged them to stay for the refreshments and she rushed to call for the waiters who in a few minutes came wheeling tray carts with coffee and many kinds of pastry and little sandwiches of various sorts and other refreshments, so that there were more waiters than there were guests and they got in each other's way and they looked at each other in bewilderment and could not under­stand. But Dolores flitted from the waiters to her guests, urging each in turn to serve well and to enjoy themselves so that in despair, and in disregard of their usually dignified manners, the ten guests got up and fled without more than fearful and embarrassed smiles at Dolores. The waiters, seeing the guests gone, looked questioningly at Dolores once and they too left.</p>
<p>"Now Dolores was left alone in the Blue and Gold Room. Her face was flushed and her eyes shone, yet there was a troubled expression on her face. 'And why have you departed so hastily?' she mournfully addressed the empty hall. 'Are not these accommodations to your taste? In that case the fault is all mine. And what of the refreshments? Were they not well prepared? All, dear ladies, your forgiveness,' and Dolores clumsily curtsied toward the empty chairs. 'I have made the preparations poorly, it would seem, though, and I mean no harm or disrespect, you should have stayed a little longer and tasted at least of the refreshments. And also,' she added, a sly smile suffusing her face, 'I wanted you to see my dance which I practiced especially for you.'</p>
<p>"Oblivious of her surroundings, Dolores took out a filmy scarf and daintily smiling and lightly bowing in all directions began to pirouette slowly about the hall. Her breath failed her quickly and she had to stop often to rest, and as she did so she addressed her invisible audience: 'Dear ladies, you have fled my castle. Was it those rude servants,' and she pointed to the entrance from the catering room, 'was it they who frightened you off? You should not have fled. Had you but said so I would have complained to the master of the castle and he would quickly have set matters right, for I will have you know, dear ladies, that this is a noble castle indeed where no word is wrongly spoken to ladies of noble birth such as you are.'</p>
<p>"Having taken her moment's rest she resumed her dance, moving more slowly down the length of the hall, stopping before each of the empty upholstered chairs and bowing solemnly.</p>
<p>"Meantime the door to the catering room opened a crack and the waiters bunched about it and snickered and shoved each other in the ribs, until the manager became aware of the doings in the Blue and Gold Room.</p>
<p>"He entered the room and looked with consternation at Dolores' pirouetting. He did not understand, but he was a man trained in hotel management. 'Madam, what are you up to?' he asked firmly, but not too roughly.</p>
<p>"Dolores ignored him a second as she executed a turn that was too difficult for her. Then she addressed him curtly, 'Go and do not trouble my noble guests.'</p>
<p>"The manager approached her and lightly took her arm. 'Lady, your guests have all gone. Why don't you go too? Please don't cause a dis­turbance.'</p>
<p>"But Dolores waived him aside. For one second she stopped, aware of herself and the man and the room, and declared firmly, "I have rented this hall till six. It is mine for another hour and a half,' and she imperiously ordered the manager to leave. He was puzzled for a moment, then he ordered the waiters to close the door to the catering room and to return to their duties, and he too left the hall and firmly closed the door behind himself.</p>
<p>"Left alone, Dolores resumed her dance."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The room was silent. Jacob turned his head toward Rose. She seemed not to have stirred all this time. Her eyes were open.</p>
<p>"This is the last one," he declared.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Rose?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Be my friend."</p>
<p>"I like you."</p>
<p>He moved up to the bed. There was a plea in his voice, "Be my girl friend," he whispered and tentatively held out his hand in a gesture of expectancy.</p>
<p>Rose stretched and yawned. The impish gleam reappeared in her eyes and she drawled, "G'wan, you're kidding," but seeing the misery on his face she added more kindly, "I'm tired. Do be a good guy and go now. May I sleep here tonight?" she added as an afterthought.</p>
<p>"Of course, of course," he agreed without apparent emotion, and started toward the door.</p>
<p>"Jacob," she called to him as he was about to leave.</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"I like you. Next time."</p>
<p>He went out into the street where the aroma of late night had descended.</p>
<p>"Next time," he muttered to himself. "Next time, next day, next week, next month, next year. Next year? Next year in Jerusalem. Next Year in Jerusalem. NEXT YEAR IN JERUSALEM!"</p>
