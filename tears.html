    <h1>Tears in Utopia</h1>
<p class=topnote>[Commentary, "From the American Scene”, September 1954]</p>
<p>In an Israeli paper not long ago, I read: "The fight between the right- and left-wing members of Kibbutz Beth El became a pitched battle. Some Mapam members barricaded themselves in the dining hall and refused to allow the evening meal to be served. Right-wing Mapai elements attempted to storm the barricade and also to enter the kitchen through the unprotected windows. A similar battle took place near the cow barns. It was a shame­ful and humiliating struggle between people dedicated to the ideal of self-labor and collective living who had together spent the best years of their lives to build this settlement on collective lines of social justice and to wrest from the teeth of the desert a patch of ground as a home for them­selves and their children and for the dispersed of our people who are being gathered in the land of their fathers. Rena B., of the Mapam faction which had entrenched itself in the communal kitchen, screamed at her opponents: 'I will yet see you hanged on the trees before this dining hall when the forces of socialism free our country from the clutches of American imperial­ism!'"</p>
<p>Though of late I had become accustomed to such reports in the Israeli press, I found it hard to account for the passion and violence attending the struggle between left and right in the collective settlements. I knew the tenseness of kibbutz life. I recalled the heat with which the general meetings in kibbutzim discussed such matters as private money, acceptance of gifts from outside, and other "bourgeois deviations" which they felt threatened the purity of their collectivist principles. But no matter how bitter the contention it never gave way to physical violence. One incident which I witnessed in a kibbutz long ago came back to my mind. Two men had quarreled over something. It was a personal disagreement that generated much anger. The two contenders seemed to be on the verge of blows. They were separated before a hand had actually been lifted. But even though no blows had been exchanged, the entire kibbutz went about with downcast eyes for weeks afterward. "How could such a thing have come to pass in our midst?" people muttered with shame. "What are we coming to when two com­rades almost strike each other because of some disagreement?"</p>
<p>I therefore read the frequent reports of physical strife in the kibbutzim with perplexity. Something must have happened that I did not understand, I said to myself. But these fights were far away, and I found myself writing off the reports of violence as mere newspaper sensationalism.</p>
<p>But I could not so shrug off the fight in Kibbutz Beth El. I had spent some months there many years ago, and I knew Rena B., the one who had screamed that she hoped to see her adversaries hanged before the dining hall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps it is an exaggeration to say that I "knew" Rena. I am not sure I ever said a word to her during the whole six months that I stayed in Kibbutz Beth El, except for formal greetings. Nor did she speak to me. Indeed, what conversation could there have been between us--I a youngster of eighteen, and Rena then an "old lady" of about thirty? In my youthful romanticism I regarded her with a measure of reverent awe. She was a vatika, one of the old-timers, one of the select handful that had founded Kibbutz Beth El some ten years earlier. She and her kind were spiritual aristocrats, their principles tried, their personal qualities of devotion to the ideal and readiness for all kinds of self-sacrifice tested. And who was I? A young man, virtually a boy still, who came from America—this in itself being a somewhat dubious recommendation for the idealistic life of a socialist kibbutz. I knew my shortcomings and felt duly humble toward these tested veterans. I had a vague yet strong premonition that I would not stay in Kibbutz Beth El permanently because—well, because I was young and the world was big and there were many things to be seen and lived and experienced. The thought of permanence anywhere, even in this ideal social cell of the future, filled me with unease. I suspected that everyone knew of my hank­erings after strange gods and still stranger places, and I felt a traitor to the Cause. What right had I to tread the hallowed ground of Beth El, consecrated by hard labor and socialist faith, when I was a deserter at heart?</p>
<p>But though Rena and I had no cause to speak to each other, we could not avoid exchanging formal greetings every day. The reason was simple: Rena and I shared the same room.</p>
<p>I think I'd better explain how this unorthodox arrangement came about. When I came to Beth El it was already a veteran kibbutz ten years old. This may not sound like a great age, but at that time and in that place it was considerable. The signs of economic and social maturity were in evidence everywhere. Beth El is situated on a rocky hilltop and the road leading up to the settlement was then already lined with trees of respectable height. The fields, too, showed their years of cultivation, the orchards bore fruit, the vineyard was in its prime. There were many married couples and children. But most significant was the housing: there was not a tent left, and everybody lived in wooden barracks. There was even talk of paved walks, so that one should not have to wade through the deep mud in the winter to the dining hall, though this last suggestion was still derided as a symptom of bourgeois softness.</p>
<p>To hear the old-timers talk, Beth El was already showing many signs of bourgeois degeneration. For instance, there was the preoccupation with cleanliness. At one time things had been different. "We lived in tents then," the veterans--especially the bachelors--would reminisce. "There were no houses, no electricity, no running water. We hauled our water in barrels from a spring two miles away, and we used kerosene lamps in the big dining tent. We worked hard all day and danced through the nights. And if the floor of a tent needed sweeping, we'd pick up the tent and move it a few feet away. Yes, those were the days. Now the tarbutniks [culturists] have taken over," they would conclude ruefully, "and are installing middle class virtues again."</p>
<p>It appeared that the "middle class virtues," as expressed in keeping the floors tolerably clean, came in when the barracks supplanted the tents. Some communal committee or other, after duly consulting its revolutionary conscience, decided that swept floors were not contrary to one-hundred-per­cent socialist equality; a handwritten notice posted on the wall of the dining hall appealed to the unmarried men to pay a little more attention to the state of their living quarters. The appeal was worded diplomatically. No names were mentioned, but it contained some sarcastic allusions hinting that living quarters in a socialist settlement need not bear any resemblance to pigsties, and that a kibbutz, as a higher form of social existence, should also prove its superiority and set an example in such things as order, cleanliness, etc., etc.</p>
<p>Alas, this appeal had no effect. The bachelors, who lived four to a room, were set in their ways. They were perfectly willing to do danger­ous guard duty miles away from the settlement, or to perform all kinds of volunteer labor on Saturdays, whenever emergencies such as plagues of field mice or especially hot winds threatened the harvest. But to pick up a broom and sweep the floor of their room, that was a different matter. Who was going to be first to pick up the bourgeois implement? On occasion, espe­cially in the winter when much mud was tracked indoors, the bachelors would finally attack the job of cleaning their floors, but usually only after the task had become one to boast of with some bravado. "We cleaned our room today," one would announce. "You could plant potatoes in the mud, it was so deep."</p>
<p>But Beth El was growing. Temperaments were cooling off. There were growing children in the settlement, and though these lived in separate children's houses and spent their free time with their parents, they would sometimes wander into the bachelors' rooms. A bad example was being set for them. In their own houses everything was kept as clean as possible, and the importance of washing behind the ears was appropriately impressed upon them. Yet here were these rooms displaying a devil-may-care attitude toward the amenities of civilized life that belonged to an earlier, more turbulent era.</p>
<p>In accord with the principles of collective living, a committee was appointed to study the problem. The committee brought in its report and recommendations soon after. The problem was a tough one and truly revolu­tionary measures were required to solve it. The committee's proposal was simple; put the unmarried men into rooms with the unmarried women--two men and two women to a room. The girls--allowing for unnatural exceptions--kept their quarters clean automatically. This seemed to be a trait of womanhood not modified by the passage from an individualist private-enterprise society to a socialist collectivist one. The two girls in a room would look after its cleanliness for two days. The young men would then feel morally obli­gated to do their share of sweeping and scrubbing the following two days.</p>
<p>The recommendation was received with applause. The bachelors did not fail to see the trap set for them, but submitted with good grace. After all, a kibbutz is more than a society built on collective ownership and the sharing of all economic assets. It is also a group of friends bound to­gether by a great vision, a closely knit family of hundreds of people. At least it was like this at that time.</p>
<p>Thus it came about that I was assigned to the room in which Rena B. lived.</p>
<p>This system, weird through it must appear to anyone unfamiliar with kibbutz mentality and mores, worked out quite well as long as it lasted. It was surprising to discover how much privacy one could enjoy even though crowded together with three others of different sexes in one small room. There was a great deal of respect for one another, not the conventional respect that shows itself in formal phrases, but a much more profound one that disregarded formalities but carefully refrained from infringing on the neighbor's individuality. The matter of dressing and undressing, for instance, presented no problem at all. One would automatically go out on the porch, or turn away when the weather was too inclement to go outside, if a member of the other sex in the room wished to go to bed. Kibbutzniks were conditioned that way. They would no more dream of infringing on each other's privacy than they would of stealing. Individual moods, too, were strictly respected. In a closed group like Beth El such moods could be gauged very easily, and once it became apparent that someone had a matzav ruach--a state of mind—he or she was left strictly alone.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the bachelors were seldom in their rooms, except for the few hours of sleep each night. The average age was low, there was an abundance of energies seeking an outlet and these were ex­pended in the dining hall, which also served as social center. There one could sing, dance, be with other people, talk. The room itself had few attractions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About two months before I left Beth El, Rena began to behave strangely. The only symptom that I could discern was that she had many "moods." Frequently, when I returned to the room in the evening, I would find her lying in bed and staring fixedly at the ceiling. She would return my greeting with ill-concealed irritation till I decided it might be best not to say anything at all. In the dining hall too she behaved strangely, avoiding company and leaving as soon as she had finished eating. Sometimes when I returned late I would find her in bed, her face buried in her pillow. But she was not sleeping, because her shoulders twitched convulsively.</p>
<p>This went on for some weeks. In the ignorance of my youth, I did nor surmise what troubled her. She was so much older, so superior in her accomplishments, that I would have considered it impudence even to try to understand her grief. I took it for granted that it must be profound and cosmically tragic in nature, and left it at that.</p>
<p>My male roommate opened by eyes. "Our Rena is having a rough time," he once said to me casually when we were at table in the dining hall.</p>
<p>"Yes," I responded vaguely and knowingly, hoping that he would change the subject. Other people's griefs, particularly the woes of an august person like Rena, were too "sacred" to be probed by a youngster like me.</p>
<p>"For some reason she seems to feel that he is her last chance," he added, assuming that I knew what he was talking about. When he realized my ignorance he explained the mystery to me.</p>
<p>The mystery was simple enough. Its name was Chaim.</p>
<p>Chaim was an important man in Beth El. He was an "old" man by my standards of that time, perhaps as old as the mid-thirties. He, too, was one of the founders of Kibbutz Beth El. A man of even temper and cool judgment, he was looked up to with respect. Unlike many of the other men, who lightly skipped from one type of work to another, disdaining permanence in a skill as a form of bourgeois "careerism," Chaim began to specialize almost from the day Beth El was founded. Vineyards became his specialty and he knew all there was to know about them, or so it seemed to everyone in Beth El. The year before, the settlement had sent him to southern France to specialize still further in his.field. He had attended an agri­cultural school near Bordeaux for some months, then worked under the super­vision of specialists in the neighborhood. When he returned he was held in still greater esteem than before. He became a pillar of stability in the settlement. Amid the emotional turbulence that was still an outstand­ing trait of Beth El as a whole, he went about like a landowner surveying his acres. Solid citizen that he was, he decided that the time had come to marry and raise a family. He handled his marriage plans in an equally reasoned and measured manner. He sized up the situation and decided that there were two candidates who seriously came into consideration. One of these was Rena. The other was a girl somewhat younger and more vivacious.</p>
<p>He began his courtship of the two young women systematically. One day he would seek the company of one at the dinner table; the next day the other. In the evening he would take one of them for long walks in the vineyard and the orchard. Long past midnight he could be found in the dining room with his "date" for a late snack.</p>
<p>This was the period of stress in Rena's life when I would find her in her black moods. What fantasies must have raced through her mind as she lay in bed in the evenings, visualizing her Chaim in the company of the other woman in some corner of the orchard.</p>
<p>The period of indecision did not last more than a few weeks. Chaim surveyed the scene, appraised the relative advantages, and decisively made up his mind. Rena lost. He walked with her less and less frequently. At mealtimes he was now constantly in the company of her rival. Soon it was common talk that, any day now, Chaim would ask the housing committee to assign a room to him and his chosen one, and they would be married before God and man.</p>
<p>It was then that Rena gave way. One day she entered the crowded dining hall at lunchtime, saw Chaim and his chosen one together at table laughing, and burst into tears and fled to her room. That afternoon Rena did not go out to work.</p>
<p>I did not go to my room after dinner that evening. I was afraid to face what I knew I would find, and I remained in the dining hall till well past midnight. It was the rainy season, and when I finally reached the door I pulled off my mud-matted shoes and left them outside. I tiptoed in. My other two roommates were already asleep. Rena was still awake. She was crying. When I came in she quickly buried her head in her pillow and tried to suppress her sobs. But she could not, and her entire body shook under the blankets. I tiptoed out again and returned to the almost deserted dining hall.</p>
<p>This scene repeated itself almost identically the following nights. My other roommates also began avoiding the room. We stayed out as late as possible, but no matter when we returned we invariably found Rena with her face buried in her pillow. The room became a terror for us.</p>
<p>I left Beth El some weeks later. It is hard to recall the exact reasons why I left--all this happened so long ago. Of course I was young and I knew I would not rest content until I had walked every street, peered into every house, looked into every mind. But I might not have left Beth El quite so soon had it not been for Rena's weeping. Beth El was still utopia for me at that time. When I discovered the first tears in utopia, the gates of the Garden of Eden opened wide and the angel with the double-edged sword shouted his command.</p>
