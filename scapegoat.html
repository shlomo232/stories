    <h1>The Scapegoat</h1>
    <p>On the eve of the Day of Atonement the moon is almost full and when not covered with clouds its light suggests things long forgotten.</p>
<p>I am not a religious man. I do not observe religious ceremonies. I was brought up in strict orthodoxy in a small town in Russia, but I practice few of its commandments. My drift from orthodoxy was gradual but steady, and by the time I was in my late teens it was almost complete. One thing remained--sharp memory on the Day of Atonement. All other holidays and religious feasts or fast days leave me largely unmoved, but not Yom Kippur--the Day of Atonement. I observe none of the practices associated with it, but when this day comes I am tense and anxious and scarcely know what to do with myself.</p>
<p>My friends with backgrounds like mine suffer from a similar unease.</p>
<p>"It is a conditioned reaction," said one of them when I saw him last Yom Kippur. "We miss the catharsis that goes, or used to go with the ritual of the Day of Atonement."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," I said. "But the jargon of psychology is not more con­soling than any other."</p>
<p>"What do you want then?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. But in recent years an event of long ago has come to stay with me each Yom Kippur eve."</p>
<p>"It sounds plausible that anxiety should become fixed in an obsession." "What if it is an obsession? Obsessions have meaning."</p>
<p>"What is this memory that comes back to you at this particular time?"</p>
<p>"It happened nearly forty years ago, in 1919, in my native town in Russia. It was a time of lawlessness, banditry, violence. The countryside was overrun by bandit groups under self-appointed chieftains. And much of this violence was directed against Jews. Pogroms and the rumor of pogroms were our daily bread. I was a boy still under ten. Our town on the plains of the western Ukraine had a population of a few thousand, mostly Jews. The streets were unpaved. The water supply came from a few wells. The houses were of clay or wood. Lighting was by candle or a burning wick floating in a dish of oil.</p>
<p>"There was a man in town. We called him Yitzl. It was an uncommon name. I think it derived from Yitzhok. He was the town idiot and to us children, it seemed natural that his name should be as uncommon as himself.</p>
<p>"He was a rather handsome man, as I recall, tall and well-built and strong. And there was always a smile on his face. He was about thirty years old, but his mental age must have been that of a seven- or eight-year old. He was alert and cheerful and docile, and, not without a trace of genius of a sort that had remained as stunted as his other mental faculties.</p>
<p>"As I remember him he was the town water carrier and wood chopper and performed other simple tasks that required strength and willingness to work.</p>
<p>"Did Yitzl have a home? It seemed inconceivable to us normal children that such a man should have a home. Yet, I suppose, he did sleep under some roof. Perhaps in the ante-room of the synagogue, or in the town bath house. Did he have parents? It did not occur to us that he could have a father and mother like the rest of us. He was simply there and we did not think of his origins, though the older people no doubt knew. It was fun for us to run after him when he carried his pair of buckets of water on a yoke from the well, or to bait him from a safe distance while he chopped a cord of wood for some housewife. But it was not really neces­sary to keep at a distance, for Yitzl was the mildest of men and was never angry.</p>
<p>"He had a stunted gift for mathematics, to the amusement of all with whom he had dealings. He would deliver his buckets of water, and while resting a moment before returning to the well, he would half-speculate and half-inquire: 'Well, now, what do you think? How many buckets of water are there in the well?' Or: 'How many eggs do you think could be cooked in the boiler of the town bath house?' When chopping wood he might speculate on the number of pieces of wood that could be laid end to end to make an unbroken row from one end of town to the other. His face would then glow with delight at the possibilities. 'How many do you think?' he might ask. 'A thousand? A million?' I don't believe he had a clear conception of these numbers, but they were large and had splendid names that promised so much.</p>
<p>"'A madman, a regular meshugener,' the housewife to whom Yitzl was just then delivering water would exclaim. 'Run along now, it's getting late and the water barrel is only half full. Did you ever hear of such a thing?' she might conclude half-scolding and perhaps also half-suspecting some uncommon sense in the ridiculous question. Until now water had been simply water—handy when in the kitchen barrel, useless at the bottom of the well, dangerous in the depths of the river. But now he had established some uneasy relationship between the different waters. It was not simply a question of the amount of labor required to transport the water from one place to the other. He had suggested a more intimate relationship between the water for household use and the deeps of the earth.</p>
<p>"Yitzl would lift up his yoke and empty buckets and go back to the well, still smiling, still wondering and looking just a little triumphant.</p>
<p>"Thus Yitzl lived in our midst, until Yom Kippur day in 1919. There had been rumors of threat for some days. It was said that a notorious band of partisans in the district was approaching our town. Terror seized the people. However, on Yom Kippur eve, nearly everyone went to synagogue. It was, after all, the most solemn day in the year--the Day of Atonement. But when we returned to our darkened homes, there was no sleep. Foreboding was in the air. About eleven o'clock a mournful Slavic tune was heard from afar, the sound of soldiers singing. And then they came, hundreds of them, mounted on horses whose hides glistened in the light of the nearly full moon. Their song echoed from the walls and drifted slowly into the distance. They passed through the main street and soon were lost beyond a hill.</p>
<p>"The following day no one dared venture out to the synagogue, for though the riders of the night before were not in town, they could not be far away. Each household whispered its prayers privately, dreading the hours as they dragged. Outside, the autumn sunlight mourned softly in the deserted streets.</p>
<p>"When darkness fell and the fast was broken, some of the braver souls ventured outside, hugging walls and fences, and soon the word spread: 'Yitzl has been killed!'"</p>
<p>"He had found shelter in a home near the outskirts of town. During the day two armed horsemen from the band that passed the previous night came briefly into town. By chance they stopped at this house and knocked on the door. No one inside dared answer the call. Instead they asked Yitzl to go out and see what the armed riders wanted. Docile and smiling, he obeyed. They let him out through the rear door and quickly locked it behind him. Through a gap in the curtains they watched his progress. They saw him approach the horsemen. They saw Yitzl's smiling lips reply, and then he was cut down with a saber. The horsemen rode off.</p>
<p>"The town did well by Yitzl. It is reckoned a good deed to give decent burial to the dead. It was a doubly good deed in this case, for, though an idiot, he was a martyr who gave his life for the 'Sanctification of the Name.' He was quickly buried. The prayer for the dead was hurriedly recited over his grave, and the town resumed the contemplation of its terror.</p>
<p>"He was the only victim that Day of Atonement, and soon forgotten. I too forgot him till suddenly, a few years ago, while walking in the moon­light of Yom Kippur eve, anxious and distressed, and annoyed with my vague distress, he returned to memory still smiling, not the least bitter over his betrayal, still asking his eternal questions: 'How many buckets of water are there in the river? How many eggs can be cooked in the ocean? How many galaxies are there in the universe? How many wooden yokes, the kind on which one carries two buckets of water, would have to be laid end to end to reach infinity? Thousands? Millions? What a wonderful word, millions! Just imagine!</p>
<p>"But mainly I terribly want to know: What did the innocent, child­like idiot say to that armed bandit? Did he ask one of his unanswerable 'how many's' or did he, on that solemn day, change his question to 'Why?'</p>
<p>"The people of that town have long been scattered or dead. The very name of that town is seldom remembered by those who left it.</p>
<p>"But each Yom Kippur Yitzl returns and smilingly lends his weight to the dim burden of distress."</p>
