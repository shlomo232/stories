    <h1>An Inquiry into "Personals" Ads</h1>
    <p>"Loneliness Kills" the ad in the Personals column I was reading announced in bold type.</p>
<p>I yawned politely and mumbled to myself: "What else is new? Sure loneliness kills; so do wars and old age and cancer and drunken driving and a whole lot of other things."</p>
<p>All the same I continued reading the ad, and the one that followed, and all the others on the page.</p>
<p>Why was I reading the "Personals" ads? Here a word of explanation is in order. It's this way. There came a time in my life, as I am sure it comes to many others, when I discovered that I was lonely. Not lonely in a crowd, or any other such poetic notion, but just plain lonely. You know what I mean. One goes to a lecture or a concert or whatever, and then it's over, and everybody disperses God knows where, and one finds one­self all alone. And after this happens once and twice and many times, one even stops going out. Lectures I don't need, and as for concerts--well, I got a radio, no? And also a TV, and I get a newspaper delivered at the door, except when there is a blizzard or a strike. So . . . </p>
<p>Well, after a while this sort of thing began to bother me. In fact it got to be quite bad. And one day it came to me in a flash, a kind of revelation: This sort of thing, if it lasts long enough, can kill. Yes, loneliness can kill.</p>
<p>What to do about it, that was the problem. I thought of any number of things, like joining the Communist Party, starting a new religion, going on walkathons, but I knew it wouldn't work. So I fell back on dialec­tics. Please don't ask me to define dialectics. I am not sure I could. In fact, I am quite sure I couldn't. But many years ago, as a youngster I toyed with the idea, and all that was left me of that time was that dia­lectics meant a kind of mixing of opposites to get something better than either. For instance, say you have a hangover. Then you drink a cup of black coffee, and that takes care of the problem. Or, you are hungry, and then you eat, and that takes care of that. So now I applied this dialec­tical--I might say Maoist--approach to my predicament. What's the opposite of loneliness? I asked myself. Why, companionship, I answered quick as a flash. It was that easy. And if you need or want something, how do you go about finding it? Why, of course, in the yellow pages or in classified ads. And that's how, by a process of dialectical reasoning I came to make a study of the Personals columns in various publications.</p>
<p>First off I went to the corner newsstand and asked the man to give me some publications that carry Personals ads. He gave me an armload. Well, well, I said to myself, I hadn't known loneliness had undone so many. What didn't he give me? The Village Voice and Screw, the NY Review of Books and The New Republic, and many many others.</p>
<p>Some of these, like Screw, I ruled out right away. They used such indelicate words and pictures. Me, I was interested in companionship, true companionship, and let it lead where it may.</p>
<p>But here a new problem arose. On the face of it, what could be simpler than the idea of companionship. But not so. Reading the Personals I learned that companionship comes in an almost endless variety of forms. There is warm companionship, and affectionate companionship, devoted companionship and mature companionship, companionship as an end in itself and companionship that may lead to other relationships, which in turn may become permanent, or semi-permanent, or intimate to a bewildering variety of degrees. How is one to choose among all this abundance? Which is better? Warm or affectionate or devoted companionship? Who is a more likely candidate for warm companionship? One who likes tennis, or one who likes to jog? One who is a gourmet or one who is satisfied with a medium-rare hamburger sandwich?</p>
<p>Well, what are you going to do about it? I said to myself.</p>
<p>It's a bad habit I developed over the years, talking—mostly arguing — with myself. So for purposes of convenience I like to refer to my two egos as I1 and I2' It kind of simplifies matters.</p>
<p>I1: What can I do? The donkey between two bales of hay had it easy by comparison and he died.</p>
<p>I2: But look, fella. You got a problem—loneliness. Right? And you want to solve it. Right? And now you complain of an overabundance of potential companionship. Well get it straight, nobody died of surfeit.</p>
<p>I1: That's what you think. What about all those Merovingian French Kings? They died of surfeit. Didn't they?</p>
<p>I2: Don't kid yourself. You are no Merovingian king. You aren't even French.</p>
<p>That got me. Besides, I don't like to be taunted when I have a problem. So all I said was "Shut up!" I don't know about you, but I find logic wearisome. A plain, straightforward "Shut Up" is usually best. It stops the argument and spares my self-esteem at the same time.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the problem remained, and I2, being a part of myself, was anxious to help.</p>
<p>I2: Look, let's be realistic. I realize the predicament you are in. So why not grab the bull by the horns?</p>
<p>I1: Grab the what by the which?</p>
<p>I2: (Now slightly annoyed.) Grab the bull by the horns. What's the matter with you. OK, let me put it in simpler terms. If the mountain won't come to Mohammed, then let Mohammed go to the mountain.</p>
<p>I1: As if I don't have enough trouble with loneliness which is killing me, you are trying to involve me in politics. For God's sake, what've Mohammed and mountains got to do with it?</p>
<p>I2: (Now mollified.) Don't get mad. I know your nerves are on edge. It was just a manner of speaking. What I meant was that if you can't pick someone from the Personals ads, why don't you put in an ad of your own. Then the right party or parties will come to you. Isn't this reasonable?</p>
<p>He really had something there, but of course I wouldn't concede it outright. It's not in my nature to make concessions. I mumbled something in a gruff tone to salve my pride, but just the same I took out a sheet of paper, I sharpened a ballpoint pen, and began to compose. I2 stood behind me and looked over my shoulder.</p>
<p>"Gentleman," I wrote. At this I could hear I2 snicker. Now, I hate to have someone looking over my shoulder. I especially hate it when they also snicker. But I wasn't going to be distracted. The situation was desperate. So I merely clenched my teeth and growled, "Shaddup."</p>
<p>"Handsome," I wrote. At this I2 emitted a strange noise. It's hard to describe it. It resembled a cross between a Bronx cheer and the sound made by a young rooster learning how to crow. I turned and looked a few daggers at I2: "Oh, it's nothing," I2 mumbled apologetically. "I was only clearing my throat."</p>
<p>I accepted his apology, but all the same I crossed out "Handsome" and substituted "Still handsome, in a manner of speaking."</p>
<p>"Not very young, but on the other hand, not all that old either," I continued composing. Behind me there was a prolonged mmmm.</p>
<p>"What is it now?" I turned on I2 in a rage.</p>
<p>I2: I was just thinking, aren't you getting a little longwinded? You know how much these ads cost?</p>
<p>I1: Well, I got to tell about myself, don't I? And I won't descend to lying.</p>
<p>I2: OK, go on. Only don't make it a biography in four volumes, considering the cost. And as for being truthful, well, of course, I mean sure, but all the same . . . and his voice trailed off.</p>
<p>I thought a moment then continued composing my ad: "Hates jogging because convinced there can't be any companionship to speak off while jog­ging." And at this point I stopped. Somehow I felt I wasn't saying what I really wanted to say, so after a little reflection I decided, Hell, I'll tell it like it is. That's the highest truth; and with renewed vigor I applied myself to the job on hand. "Look," I wrote. "Get this straight. I am lonely. Loneliness kills. And me, I am dying of loneliness. I don't want music. For that I got a radio. I don't want modern poetry. For that I can go to the church around the corner which offers a regular diet of poetry readings by poets I never heard of. What I want is com­panionship. Yeh, companionship, and I don't give one good goddamn whether a suitable companion smokes or not, likes or dislikes water sports, prefers clam chowder to chicken soup, is slim or otherwise, is a PhD or a dropout from a little red schoolhouse. Com-pa-nion-ship: That's the name of the game I am interested in, and let it lead wherever it may. I have only one little—really minor—condition. The prospective companion must not have false teeth. I got my own."</p>
<p>After this outburst I stopped for a moment. What more could I say? Plenty, of course. But was it necessary? If this cri de coeur doesn't produce results, what good will an additional one hundred or one thousand words accomplish? Still, perhaps a few reassuring words, so that potential companions shouldn't think I am altogether desperate. Desperation might scare off just the person I am trying to entice.</p>
<p>And just at this moment the phone rang. Both I1 and I2 made a dash for the phone but stopped short. To answer or not to answer? In the end I decided to answer.</p>
<p>In this regard I follow Tom Sawyer's Law. Tom Sawyer's Law deals with hunting for treasure, it's true, but it applies equally to answering the telephones. You see, when hunting for treasure most people do so at the right time (midnight), in the right place (under the tip of a dead branch sticking out of an old cottonwood tree) and they dig for hours, maybe six feet down, then they give up in despair. And next day, in bright sunlight, someone comes along, sees the pit, turns over two or three shovels of earth and there it is, a brass-bound chest full of pieces-of-eight and doubloons and such like. And it's the same with phone calls. You keep on answering the phone time and again and it's all dry runs—wrong numbers, or someone offering you two free dancing lessons if you sign up for the short course of 64 paid-for lessons, or advice on how best to invest savings you haven't got. Most people stop answering just when statistically a worthwhile call is bound to come, and they miss their chance. Well, I wasn't going to miss mine.</p>
<p>"Hello," I said in my best executive tone, the one that suggests that I am a friendly person willing to give careful consideration to any reason­able proposal, but also, on the other hand, that I am a very busy man, and I have three other important calls on "hold" and will not have my precious time trifled with.</p>
<p>"Hi there," a cheery woman's voice greeted me. "Remember me? We met a while ago, at Joe's Bar, on Seventh Avenue. Quite a while ago, in fact. Must have been in the early fifties. And I asked you who you were, and you said you were the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, and I said, What? All ten of them? and you said, How else? I wouldn't settle for less, and I said . . ."</p>
<p>Did I remember Joe's Bar on Seventh Avenue! A surging. tidal wave of nostalgia crashed over me. Actually I remembered Joe's Bar for not remem­bering. You know what I mean. One comes in feeling blue and one orders a double 100 proof Old Overholt with a beer chaser, and soon another to keep the first company, and right away things begin to look fine; so one has still another one and everything is finer yet. Only after a while of this sort of thing memory begins to fade until there is a total blank. And, of course, the next morning one feels like grabbing the first transcontinental Trailways bus out of town. (Trailways were cheaper than Greyhound.) For who knows that awful things had been said and what crimes committed while not remembering.</p>
<p>I didn't remember the author of the cheery greeting on the phone, but what did it matter. Here was a veritable Act of God bringing salvation. "Do I remember you!" I exclaimed. "Oh lost, and by the wind grieved ghost, Return."</p>
<p>There was a moment's silence, then, "What?" she shrieked. "What's that you said?"</p>
<p>Slam. And she hung up.</p>
<p>How did I feel? Well, crestfallen, of course. But also nonplussed, and cancelled, and X-d out. And just then I2 went for me. He always does when I am in the dumps.</p>
<p>I2: You had to open your big mouth.</p>
<p>I1: Aw, dry up. What did I say? All I did was quote Thomas Wolfe.</p>
<p>I2: (Mimicking me.) All I did was quote Thomas Wolfe. Look man, don't you know nobody quotes Thomas Wolfe nowadays. Maybe Tom Wolfe, but never Thomas Wolfe.</p>
<p>I1: I don't care who does what. Thomas Wolfe was a great writer.</p>
<p>I2: That's what I mean. You are old-fashioned and you act old-fashioned, so how to you expect to find companionship.</p>
<p>Well, I don't like to be called old-fashioned so I became rather snappy.</p>
<p>I1: See here. If she met me in the early fifties she can't be such a young chick any longer and is now probably too old to jog. Besides, I still say "Only the Dead Know Brooklyn" is one of the greatest short stories ever written in America.</p>
<p>I2: (Condescendingly.) You are out of your time, man; even the dead wouldn't know Brooklyn anymore. When were you in Brooklyn last? What was the use of continuing the argument. So I didn't. But my heart ached. Brooklyn at night. Sand Street. Joe's Bar on Seventh Avenue. Look Homeward Angel. And now the anonymous and slightly hyster­ical sprite on the phone. She too was no doubt looking for companionship.</p>
<p>Tears dimmed my eyes as I mumbled, "Oh lost, and by the wind grieved ghost, Return."</p>
<p>But there is no returning. There is only now, and loneliness, and Loneliness Kills.</p>
