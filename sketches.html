<p class=subtitle>How Loud to be Heard?</p>
<p>When I think back to my first days in New York, I recall them, after the relative quiet of my home town, as a time when my ears constantly rang from the din. I could hardly hear what was said to me, and when I talked I automatically shouted, as if everyone else was equally deafened by the noise.</p>
<p>Weeks later, after I had gotten my bearings and things began to assume more normal proportions, the noise, especially the inhuman clang of the subway trains, began to intrigue me. A strange temptation seized upon me: I was tempted to find out how loud one must shout in a subway train before being heard. This question occupied my attention with increasing obsessiveness.</p>
<p>I did not make the test at once--I had my inhibitions. What would people think?</p>
<p>Finally, my curiosity gained the upper hand. Standing on the rear platform of a subway car, the doors between the cars open so that the smashing of wheels against rails filled the car, I made my first try. First I looked around to make sure there was no one near me. Then I fixed an intent expression on my face, as if I was deep in thought, and began in a low monotone: ahhhhhhhhhhh.</p>
<p>I could not hear myself. I raised my voice without moving my lips. I still could not hear myself. I kept raising my voice higher and higher until I felt the "ahhhhhh" vibrating in my throat. Now I could also hear it above the clatter. But no one else in the car heard me. As the train slowed down into a station, I gradually lowered my voice. Nobody had noticed my experiment. I had proved one thing: it was necessary to shout very loud before one could even hear himself. But the main question: How loud must one shout to be heard by others still remain unanswered.</p>
<p>I performed this experiment many times. It was a game, and also a challenge--to New York, to its people, to the world. I taunted them: See? A man can shout and scream right near you and you wouldn't hear him. You, too, might do it, and nobody would hear you either.</p>
<p>Gradually I overcame my diffidence and performed these experiments under ever more tantalizing conditions. I would start my monotone "ahhh" even when other people were on the car platform. I would begin low and keep an eye on my fellow-passengers to see if they had noticed. As soon as I would begin to hear myself, I would raise the pitch very slowly, and when I reached what I thought was a danger zone, I would stop-for the time being, satisfied with the result.</p>
<p>This went on for some time. I was beginning to enjoy it tremendously. The early "social" implications of the experiment were forgotten and only abstract, "scientific," curiosity remained.</p>
<p>There is no telling how long this experimenting might have gone on. It was brought to a sudden halt by the following incident. I was in the midst of one of my experiments. The IRT train rattled along, not too fast, but with the usual immense noise. It was summer and the doors between the cars were open. A number of people were on the plat­form. I kept raising my voice louder and louder. A woman nearby began to stare at me. Her face, which had been blank, began to glow with terror. Her eyes seemed to dilate and she cautiously backed away and edged into the car. Though I pretended not to have noticed her, I stopped at once. I followed her with a side-long glance. She sat down near another woman who was reading a paper, nudged her and pointed in my direction. could almost hear her whisper: There, that guy on the platform, he's crazy; he's hollering to himself.</p>
<p>The other woman listened, then her face, which had been blank, be­came animated with fear. Quickly she folded her paper, got up and walked into the next car.</p>
<p>I got off at the next station. I never shouted in subways again.</p>

<p class=subtitle>The Orphan </p>
<p>He was an old man, small and shrivelled and colorless. It was hard to tell his age. He might have been sixty-five—or ten years older. He had reached that state when it no longer mattered what his exact age was. Were he to live another twenty years he would not change. One day he would die, simply, without being sick, without suffering. He seemed already forgotten. Somehow it did not seem possible that this small man had close relatives. His near ones must have died long, long ago.</p>
<p>In the bar on the corner where he was a regular customer he was known simply as Pop. Not one of the other regular customers remembered the bar without Pop. He had always been there, part of the scene, just as he seemed to have been on earth always. He never drank much, only a glass of beer or two. He would linger over these at the far end of the bar. Sometimes he would stay for an hour, sometimes for two. Then he would leave, for home we supposed, though nobody knew or seemed to care.</p>
<p>Did Pop think as he sat hunched over his beer? It did not seem pos­sible that he could still think. Besides, what was there for him to think about?</p>
<p>The other customers never spoke to him, nor was Pop ever seen talk­ing to anyone--not even to the bartender. It was taken for granted: Pop had had his say a long time ago. There was nothing more to be said.</p>
<p>When he finally did speak he created a stir. It happened most unex­pectedly. He was sitting in the corner over his beer, as usual, brooding in his aged way. Suddenly he began to cry. He cried quietly, without sound, only the tears rolled down his face and his body twitched. Because of his place in the corner none of the customers noticed it at first. His strange behavior finally caught the bartender's eye.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Pop?" he asked.</p>
<p>The old man did not answer, but the news quickly flowed the length of the bar: "Pop is crying," and all conversation halted as everyone looked toward him.</p>
<p>The bartender tried to soothe the old man, then he offered him another beer. It did not work. Sobs shook the old body.</p>
<p>Pop's lips moved and those next to him heard him mumble through his tears: "I'm an orphan."</p>
<p>"You are what?" the bartender shouted.</p>
<p>"I am an orphan," the old man repeated to himself, oblivious of bar­tender and customers.</p>
<p>"Did you hear what he said?" the bartender addressed his customers. "He says he's an orphan."</p>
<p>"Hey, Pop, when did you get to be an orphan?" he turned to the old man.</p>
<p>But there was no laughter from the bar. Instead, everyone felt ill at ease and quickly gulped their drinks.</p>
<p>"There, now," the bartender tried to console the old man. "We are all orphans; most all of us, anyway, except little kids. Stop crying and have another beer, on the house."</p>
<p>The sobs which had convulsed Pops body stopped, but the tears con­tinued rolling down his cheeks. He mumbled indistinctly: "I'm an orphan. When I was a kid, my dad, he used to . . .",</p>
<p>Pop's reference to his father as Dad made everyone feel worse. Some of the customers downed the remains of their drinks and left quickly. The others fidgeted uncomfortably.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Pop laboriously descended from his stool and slowly walked to the door.</p>
<p>"I got nobody now; I'm an orphan, he was heard saying as he walked out.</p>
<p>He never returned to the bar.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Thleep</p>
<p>I took ten out from my job as dishwasher in back of the cafeteria and went out front into the street for a smoke. It was four in the after­noon. A boy about fourteen years old had seen me come out and approached me; "Hey, Mister, you work in the restaurant?"</p>
<p>His clothes were crumpled, his shirt collar was none too clean, but otherwise he looked like a clean-cut kid: there was a frank expression on his face.</p>
<p>"Yeh, I work here," I said.</p>
<p>"Can you get me something to eat?"</p>
<p>"What's the matter? Haven't you got a home?"</p>
<p>"I'm on my own," he said, but there was no arrogance either in his face or voice. It was quite obvious: the boy had run away from home. He was from out-of-town, some distance away. That was apparent from his crumpled clothes. He must have slept in unusual places the previous night or two.</p>
<p>I asked him to come into the kitchen with me. He refused. He was afraid of a trap, it seemed. So I brought out a sandwich. He thanked me politely and went away.</p>
<p>A couple of hours later I saw him again. By now we were old friends. "Where are you from?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Out-of-town," he answered vaguely.</p>
<p>"Where are you staying?"</p>
<p>"I don't know yet. I got to look up some people here: I'm going to stay with them."</p>
<p>"Do your folks know you are here?"</p>
<p>He did not answer and stepped away suspiciously, as if he expected me to seize him and turn him over to the police. I thought he seemed disturbed about his prospects. I wanted to talk to him and find out more about his predicament, but it was now close to seven o'clock and the cook was calling me back. There were many dinner dishes to attend to.</p>
<p>When I saw the boy again, I had finished my work and was leaving the restaurant for the night. It was now close to midnight. He approached me from a hallway and didn't seem to recognize me at first. "Mister," he began, his voice heavy with sleep. His eyes were glazed with weariness. Automatically I reached into my pocket to offer him some money. He re­jected it impatiently, hardly aware of what I was giving him.</p>
<p>"I want to thleep," he articulated heavily. "I don't want money. I want to thleep. Take me with you."</p>
<p>I did not know what to do. I could not take him with me. There was no place for him in my room. Besides, it might have been misunderstood. The morality of the city was already strong in me and whispered: Keep out of this; it's not your problem; let a cop handle it. I stood helpless, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>The boy stared at me unseeingly. Dimly aware that I would not help him, he tagged after every passerby with his sleepy, insistent querulous plea, "I wan to thleep; take me with you." But they only walked away more quickly.</p>
<p>He was on the verge of tears, yet too tired to cry. He sat down on the steps before the doorway from which he had emerged and monotonously repeated to no one in particular: "I don't want money. I want to thleep; damn it, I want to thleep."</p>

<p class=subtitle>Two Mothers </p>
<p>"But Mrs. Richards," the dentist pleaded over the telephone as I came into the waiting-room, "please, please control yourself. I under­stand, of course I understand. . . ."</p>
<p>Through the receiver came the sound of hysterical sobbing, then a sharp click as Mrs. Richards hung up. The dentist held out his hands in a gesture of despairing helplessness. I remained standing, silently inviting him to tell me what the strange call was about. Why should a woman be hysterical when calling a dentist?</p>
<p>"This has been going on for months," the dentist said, himself deeply upset. "I don't know how to put a stop to it. Someone should do something about it. I suppose I ought to find out the name of some close friend or relative of hers and tell them to do something. I hate to do it. She is almost a total stranger to me. . . . But this simply can't go on. . . ."</p>
<p>"What's the trouble?" I prompted him.</p>
<p>He was anxious to tell.</p>
<p>"This Mrs. Richards is a young woman, a widow, and she had a boy about eight years old. She moved into this neighborhood about a year ago. She brought the boy shortly after that. He was a nice kid. He had some trouble with his teeth and she was anxious not to neglect them. She must have been here half a dozen times.</p>
<p>"About four months ago the boy died--polio. I haven't seen her since, but she calls regularly every two weeks. Can you imagine about what? She calls to make an appointment for the boy; one of his upper molars troubles him, she says."</p>
<p>"What do you tell her?"</p>
<p>"What do I tell her? What can I tell her! The first time she called I was so taken aback I couldn't say a thing. She talked in detail about how the child suffered, especially at night, from his bad tooth. She described all the symptoms minutely, then she suddenly stopped and it was the same as you just heard. She started to cry hysterically and hung up. My first reaction after she hung up was to notify the police. Then I thought it over and decided not to. The poor woman has enough on her mind as it is. Besides, what could the police do? It isn't as if she doesn't realize the child is dead."</p>
<p>"What is it then?"</p>
<p>"She can't reconcile herself to the thought."</p>
<p>"And she keeps calling."</p>
<p>"Regularly, every two weeks. And always it's the same--the boy is suffering pain. Then she understands what she is saying and she starts apologizing and goes into hysterics."</p>
<p>"Four months, you say?"</p>
<p>"Yes, four months."</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders and held out his hands in a prayerful gesture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a rainy day. The sky hung a few feet above the roofs. The crowds were wet and disconsolate. Now and then someone detached himself from the dreary parade and entered the cafeteria through the revolving door, adding some more water to the soggy sawdust already clotted on the floor.</p>
<p>Through the window I could see them coming, mother and daughter. The mother was a small woman and seemed to be in her forties. She was dressed shabbily, and her thin greyish-brown coat flapped damply about her knees. Her hat had an elaborate crown of flowers which hung limp with moisture. A few wisps of hair fell from under her hat and stuck to her cheeks. Her daughter was not more than seven years old and tall for her age. Her pale, fair face looked grey in the drizzly afternoon. She had long hair which descended to her shoulders and lent an air of forlornness to her face. She clung to her mother's hand, and her grey eyes were turned to her with a trusting and obedient expression.</p>
<p>The mother was evidently upset about something and impatient with the child. She walked with small rapid steps and seemed to drag the child after her. Each time the girl stepped into a puddle, the mother violently tugged at her arm, and from the movement of her lips she seemed to be scolding her.</p>
<p>As they came abreast of the cafeteria door the mother stopped hesi­tantly. The child looked up at her face, trying to anticipate whether she wanted to go in. The mother took a tentative step toward the door. The child dropped her hand and hurried toward the entrance.</p>
<p>Just then three men entered the door one after another and turned it rapidly. Still looking back toward her mother, the little girl stepped into the door and was pushed forward violently by the wing behind her.</p>
<p>She was thrown off balance and dragged along. Someone pulled her out of the door inside and she stood bewildered and frightened, not knowing whether to stay or go out again.</p>
<p>The incident lasted only a fraction of a second. During this interval the mother remained outside, her face contorted with rage. Then she entered quickly, seized the child by the arm and shook her violently. "Are you hurt?"</p>
<p>"No, Mama."</p>
<p>The child's voice was small and appealing. I thought you wanted to come in, she seemed to say. I don't know what happened and I am fright­ened. Please don't frighten me any more.</p>
<p>The mother's damp face was livid with wrath as she hissed: "I hope you got hurt! I hope you got hurt good!" Then her voice failed her and she shook the child silently.</p>
<p>The little girl submitted meekly, her pale face turned to her mother with trusting appeal.</p>

<p class=subtitle>What I Want to Know </p>
<p>"You're a new man here. I ain't never seen you before in this bar," the husky man standing some ten feet away from me said, and moved up closer. "So maybe you can tell me. Now, what I want to know is this . . ."</p>
<p>"Oright there, Jim," the bartender intervened. "Don't you go both­ering the customers now. Drink your drink quiet or go home."</p>
<p>"I ain't bothering nobody," Jim said. "I ain't bothering no one," he repeated almost in a whisper addressing me. "But what I want to know is this, and maybe you can tell me. What I want to know is, why can't a guy who minds his own business, and don't bother nobody, be left alone, and I mean strictly alone."</p>
<p>I glanced at him briefly and said nothing. He was obviously no longer sober, and seemed to suffer from a compulsion. This was a situation that called for a quick emptying of the glass and a rapid and undramatic exit.</p>
<p>"Well? You know why?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"He gave me a hard time," Jim continued unimpressed by my lack of response, "picked an argument with me," he added self-righteously.</p>
<p>"Who did?" I asked.</p>
<p>"That's what I am trying to tell you. So here I was, right here at this very spot, having me a drink and minding my own business, strictly. And there he was, just about where you are, but he warn't like you; he gave me a hard time, I tell you.</p>
<p>"So first he calls the bartender and tells him to give me a drink, on him. And I says, 'No, thanks,' I says, because I got things on my mind. And I don't want to be bothered, and I can buy my own drinks. So then he gets sore. 'What's the matter, fella,' he says. 'Can't you be sociable?' And that's how the argument started."</p>
<p>"So what happened next?" I asked, anxious not to antagonize him. "Well, one word led to another, and then we went outside and settled it."</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>"I knocked him down. I was so sore, I hauled off and knocked him down."</p>
<p>"You were all right then," I said. "You had your satisfaction."</p>
<p>"Sure I knocked him down, and he's never been in this bar again. But you don't get the point. Who cares who knocked down who? I can knock down anybody. I can knock you down easy," he added surveying me with a professional look. "But what I want to know is not who's a better fighter. What I want to know is this, why can't a man who minds his own business and don't bother nobody be left alone? That's what I want to know!"</p>
<p>Jim’s voice rose ominously, and the bartender looked in our direction, weighing in his mind whether the situation called for his intervention.</p>
<p>I finished my drink and got up to go. Jim looked at me expectantly. "I don't know why," I mumbled. "It sure stands to reason, but then you never can tell. . ." And I walked out.</p>
<p>Jim lost his interest in me. His eyes roved the bar in search of another candidate with the right answer.</p>
