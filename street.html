    <h1>Street Scene</h1>
    <p>"Should we wait?" the woman asked her escort as they approached the fighters.</p>
<p>For an instant the man watched the unevenly matched battlers and frowned. "I don't know," he said. "I don't know. I think it's a waste of time. Let us go. We haven't much time. The Brights will come at eight-thirty sharp. They are always punctual. And you still have the shopping to do." He glanced once more at the fighters and said to his wife with finality: "Come!" Then he added as an afterthought: "Anyway, we'll pass here on the way back."</p>
<p>"We might be late," the woman said doubtfully, but obediently fol­lowed her husband.</p>
<p>The fight raged viciously on the corner in the late afternoon sun. One of the fighters was at least a head taller than his opponent and built in proportion. "I'll kill you, I'll kill you," he repeated as he methodically pummelled the smaller man about the head and the ribs. The smaller man at first vainly tried to defend himself; then seeing the hope­lessness of his struggle, he only shielded his head with his arms to ward off the blows, and through lips that were cut and bleeding, he implored: "I give up, I give up." But the bigger man ignored the pleas and contin­ued punching him hard and systematically.</p>
<p>The corner where the fight took place was at an intersection of two residential streets, and quite a number of people were about. Men walked by on their way from work, and women herded their children from neighboring</p>
<p>"Hardly worth the trouble," he muttered. "Come on."</p>
<p>"Just the same," she said again appraising the motionless form. "I think you are wrong."</p>
<p>"It's getting late," the man said irritably. "The Brights wouldn't like it, anyway."</p>
<p>"Not for the Brights," she said matter-of-factly. "I am thinking of tomorrow."</p>
<p>She put down her shopping bag on the sidewalk near the dead man and bent over him. Carefully she passed her hand over the body and gently pinched its various parts.</p>
<p>"It will do," she said. "For tomorrow."</p>
<p>"It's a waste of time," the husband repeated without conviction.</p>
<p>"Here," he said as he put down his paper bag and took a pen knife from his pocket. The woman opened it clumsily and cut away one of the dead man's trouser legs. She felt the thigh.</p>
<p>"Stringy," her husband said disapprovingly.</p>
<p>"No, just lean. It will do," she answered without looking up.</p>
<p>She carefully cut a large piece from the upper part of the thigh, wrapped it in a piece of the trouser leg and handed it to her husband. "Put it in your bag. The vegetables might get stained," she added by way of explanation.</p>
<p>He did as she told him, then picked up the bag of provisions. "Let's go," he said impatiently. "It is getting late."</p>
<p>"I'm coming, dear," she said docilely as she wiped her hands. "I'm coming right away."</p>
