    <h1>The Last Days of New York</h1>
<p>It is ten in the evening and we are packing rapidly, nervously, toss­ing things at random into two large suitcases and a small handbag. The packing doesn't really matter; the thing to do is to get away, to get away quickly. Many have already left the city. Why did we wait? It is hard to explain why we waited. I suppose we, too, had made up our minds some time ago to flee. But we never said so, not even to ourselves. Tonight, at eight, I simply said to Dora: "I am going down to the garage to have them get the car ready." She knew what I meant, and when I came back some twenty minutes later she already had most of the drawers emptied and their contents tossed on the couch and the chairs. Bobbie was dancing around in great excitement. "Are we really going?" he kept asking. "Is it because of them that we are going? Where are we going?" Bobbie is only seven. Childwise he is excited about the trip as a trip, but he under­stands too.</p>
<p>"Never mind them," I tried to speak roughly to him. "You go to bed right now; you'll have to get up early in the morning. He went obedi­ently--he is such a good child--but I suspect he is now standing behind the bedroom door watching us packing. If he does watch us I will not order him to bed again. The panic is in him too. He also wants to run away. I couldn't expect him to sleep at a time like this.</p>
<p>Dora looks nervously about the room. There are an endless number of things that should be taken along, but it is out of the question to take them all. She hates to part from them, but everything about this trip is so strange and terrifying, and we have no idea when we will be back, if ever, so that possessions that were precious some weeks ago are now really unimportant.</p>
<p>Dora looks at me and asks: "As soon as we finish?" "In the morning, at six," I reply curtly, though I am not at all angry with her. I, too, am terrified. I would like to take her and Bobbie and run away right now, leaving behind even the suitcases packed with essentials. When I tell her we will leave at six in the morning I am not being braver than she. I am simply trying to retain a last wisp of sanity in the midst of the horror and to keep the situation under some semblance of control by subjecting it to a kind of discipline. I know that I do not sound convincing and I quickly change the subject.</p>
<p>"You'd better make some coffee," I say to her. With a gesture of futility Dora drops some of Bobbie's shirts from her hands and goes toward the kitchen. The colorful striped shirts lie in a pile on the floor just as they fell from her hands. She is oblivious of them. I do not pick them up; I only stare at them. The fluffy heap of brightness on the floor is somehow symbolic of the havoc that has been wrought in everybody's life in such a short time. Dora putters in the kitchen. I go to the window. For an instant I am tempted to raise the shade, but I don't. I know too well what I will see. This is our last night in New York. Tomorrow — tomorrow we should be far away. Bobbie knows. We are leaving because of them. More than three million people have already left the city because of them. Who knows how many hundreds of thousands are tonight doing exactly what Dora and I are doing, frantically getting ready to flee. Tomorrow evening the automatic devices on the George Washington Bridge, in the two tunnels and on the bridges over the Harlem River leading North will add up the score. Somebody is still keeping count. Perhaps I'd better say somebody was still keeping count yesterday, for the count was reported in this morning's remaining newspapers: 76,487 cars left the city yester­day, in addition to the many thousands of persons who left by plane and train. Tonight even the statistician may be packing to go.</p>
<p>It is all so baffling and weird. Nobody is any longer trying to under­stand what it means. It has grown too big to handle. Yet the situation is not more than three months old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is mid-August now. The first time I encountered it was late in May. It was a nasty little experience, but certainly nothing to get seri­ously worked up about. So it seemed then.</p>
<p>I was coming home late from a meeting of the neighborhood Civil Defense unit. It had been an exciting meeting. I was accompanied by the dentist who lives in the same building with me. On the corner next to our house we were accosted by a boy about eleven years old. We hadn't noticed him till he sidled up to us. His voice was a plaintive whine as he begged for a dime. We reacted instinctively and gave him a dime apiece, and only then did it occur to us that it was rather strange for a child his age to be out in the street past midnight.</p>
<p>Neither my friend nor I are squeamish, yet as we looked down on the boy we were overcome with an involuntary loathing. In figure and dress there was nothing remarkable about him; in fact he was so inconspicuous as to be almost invisible in the yellowish light of the almost deserted street. It was his face that shocked us. It was pale in an unhealthy, damp sort of hay, and though his skin was smooth, we could not avoid the feeling that were we to touch it, it would yield to the finger like a rot­ten potato. His face was oval, his lips were thin and colorless and dis­torted in a leering smirk that disclosed two rows of even, sharp, and unusually small teeth, like those one would expect to see in a mouse. Still more upsetting were his eyes, small, deeply-set, and gleaming with a vicious, inhuman brightness that held a malevolent leer. He now held the two dimes, one in each hand, and as we stared at him in disgusted amazement, not knowing what to say, he slowly squatted to the pavement and rocked on his heels, meanwhile eyeing us insolently. There was some­thing unspeakably helpless yet depraved about him, and even as we watched him speechlessly, his face broke into a grin that was lewd beyond concep­tion. Still rocking on his heels he addressed us distinctly, "You crazy jerks." He did not alter his posture as he articulated his insult, but his body tensed noticeably, as if in anticipation of a kick or in readiness to leap away. I do not recall that I said anything. My companion gasped as if stuck with a needle. We turned sharply and rapidly walked away without looking back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I told no one about the incident, but during the following days I could not free myself from the hold which this nasty experience gained on my mind. It haunted me day and night, and at each recollection the revul­sion became more intense, instead of fading away, as might have been expected. After about three days some of my office colleagues related similar experiences. In every instance the encounter involved a boy like the one I met, except that in some of the reports the child appeared to be no more than eight or nine years old.</p>
<p>A full week passed before the disturbing new situation really struck home in my case. It was the first week in June. I happened to return home earlier than usual on that day. I expected to find Dora and Bobbie still out. Instead I found Dora in hysterics and Bobbie sitting quietly in his special rocking chair, obviously deeply shaken. Dora was not crying. As .I entered she moved as if to rush toward me, but instead she walked rapidly into Bobbie's bedroom. A moment later she returned and sat down without saying a word, alternately wringing her hands and nervously touch­ing various objects. "Bobbie, I . . ." she suddenly began screaming at the child but stopped short and dashed into the kitchen. Bobbie watched her apprehensively. All this took no more than a few seconds. I rushed after Dora into the kitchen but she did not answer my questions and turned to the window and nervously drummed on the window pane. I ran back to the child and asked him what happened. "Something bad happened, daddy," was all he had to say, and his voice was a monotone as he spoke.</p>
<p>When Dora came out of the kitchen a few minutes later she was a bit more composed though her hands still twitched nervously. I waited for her explanation. She first ordered Bobbie to go outside. Usually he is very obedient but this time he only crouched closer to the back of his chair and began whimpering. Dora forgot her order and seemed to become oblivious of his presence. She sat down near me, and then she began cry­ing. For some minutes she was too incoherent to say anything except to exclaim that "it" had been awfully terrifying. I tried to guess what might have happened. I asked leading questions. Had someone insulted her? Had someone frightened her? Had she received some shocking news? Only after her nervous sobbing subsided somewhat did I get the story of what had happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She had gone down at three to pick up Bobbie at school and then she took him along shopping for supper. On the way back, only a few houses from home, a pale and nasty-faced boy not much older than Bobbie came up and asked her for something to eat. She asked him to come along to the house. "No, gimme something from this," he pointed to her shopping bag. She put the bag down to take something from it to give to the boy, and then she noticed the strange frightening leer on his face. "What's the matter with you?" she asked, a tingle of dread coursing down her back at the unexpected expression on the boy's face. "Nothing the matter with me, lady," the boy said, and then, winking so meaningfully that there was no misunderstanding it, he added: "I like ladies like you. Gimme something to eat." As Dora told me, she tried to repress her mounting disgust and terror; she was anxious to give the boy something from the bag and to make an end of the incident. But as she bent down to take something from it, the boy shoved his hand into her bosom and in a voice charged with unnatural lechery for one his age repeated: "I like ladies. . . ." He didn't finish the sentence.</p>
<p>"Bill," Dora's voice shook as she frantically grasped my hand and almost sank her nails into it, "Bill, I slapped him; I slapped him as hard as I could. You must understand how I felt. No, you don't understand; you can't. You should have seen his face, heard his voice; he was, well, he was subterranean. It wasn't a child, I tell you. I can't describe what it was, but it wasn't human. Children aren't that way; no children, I don't care who they are, are that way. I hit him and he fell on the sidewalk. And then, all of a sudden there were two more like him stand­ing near me. I don't know where they came from. There was only this one boy when it began, and suddenly there were three of them. They didn't say anything, they just looked at me and at Bobbie in that peculiar horrible fashion, and the two new ones put their hands on Bobbie's face. He began to cry, and I --I screamed. I couldn't help myself. The two new boys ran away. The first one still lay on the sidewalk whimpering. People began running up from all sides, and the boy kept crying: 'She hit me. This lady hit me.' His face had changed somehow and he wasn't leering anymore, and all the people were blaming me and it was awful. How could I explain to them? They wouldn't have believed me. I left the bag of gro­ceries right there on the sidewalk and ran home with Bobbie. About half an hour later the doorbell rang. At first I was afraid to answer it don't know what I was afraid of. It was broad day and there are a lot of people around. But I was almost petrified when the bell rang. It kept on ringing and I finally opened the door. That boy was there again. 'Here's your groceries, lady,' he said, and there was that vicious leer in his ratty eyes again, 'I like ladies like you.' I slammed the door in his face."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such was Dora's story.. I did what I could to comfort her and Bobbie. I am afraid I wasn't too successful. I, too, was overcome with an inexplicable dread, and I could not put any real conviction in my reassurances. I felt sure somehow that the first boy was the same as the one who had accosted me and the dentist the week before. The description tallied with my recollection, which had remained vivid. But who were the other two boys? And what about the similar incidents which I heard reported by others in the office? There was something common to all of them, some thread that bound all the reports into one general suggestion of chilling import.</p>
<p>The evening hours passed somehow. We suspected each other's thoughts and talked little. But it was not necessary to talk. We were expecting the door bell to ring. It didn't. We put Bobbie to sleep. He demanded that the lights be left on and the window shades drawn all the way to the sill. We humored him. He tossed about for some time; he called us a few times; finally he fell asleep.</p>
<p>Around eleven-thirty I went out to get the early edition of the morn­ing paper. Bobbie was asleep. Dora appeared to have regained her compo­sure. Actually, I wanted to be alone for a while to sort out my thoughts. Though I am not devoid of strong emotions, I am not a sentimental man and was never known to be prone to hysterical states of mind. But now I felt off balance. This thing had to be thought out and seen in its proper per­spective. Why did I feel this irrational dread? Was there cause for it in a couple of unpleasant incidents? But if these were mere incidents, how did they somehow manage to arouse such instinctive horror?</p>
<p>I picked up my paper at the stand on the corner and stopped in the nearby cafeteria for a coffee. The news was not very new or original. Reports on the H bomb and missile tests, political disturbances here and there, an editorial calling on people to donate blood and join the Civil Defense units, assorted holdups, socialite divorces, drought in North Dakota, and similar items. I got up to go home.</p>
<p>On the corner there is a church with a broad flight of stairs leading to its entrance. There was the normal scattered late sidewalk traffic, and I noticed nothing unusual as I approached the stairway. My mind was occupied with the afternoon incident. These kids, where did they come from? I knew the neighborhood well and I had never seen boys like them before. I live in a congested district where many large expensive apart­ment houses are sandwiched in between old tenements. I know the poverty of the latter and the often grimy and unwashed youngsters who play in front of them. The children of the large apartment houses are few in number and carefully scrubbed. I had seen the poor ones fighting and playing and squabbling, but none of them was like the boy who accosted me, and none corresponded to Dora's assailants. The children of the tenements were often ill-mannered and their clothing needed washing, more likely than not. When they fought they fought hard, like adults. They were not above grabbing some toy from a child from the apartment houses. But they were wholesome children. There was nothing depraved or sickly about them. There was none of that mushroom pallor on their faces. Their eyes were clear and vivid, not mean and leering. They seldom cried, and I never heard any of them whimper or whine. I could not help feeling that the boy whom I saw the week before, and the ones who attacked Dora, did not belong in the neighborhood. They must have come from some place else. But where? I tried to visualize a neighborhood that produced their like, and I could not. This was an additional mystery. They could not have come from any place I knew. They had to emerge from some dank deep. "They crawled out of a sewer," I thought, and was about to laugh at the notion, but just then I approached the church stairway and noticed the kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were five of them sitting in a cluster on the top step near the door. I scanned them quickly and my stomach sank. I had never seen them before, but I recognized them at once as being the kids--they had all the earmarks. One of them detached himself from the group and skipped down to the bottom step. His clothes were shabby and hung loosely on his thin body. His face was inordinately long. The expression on it was on inhu­manly insolent and challenging that I had to repress a surging desire to smash it with my fist. "Mister, wait a minute," he drawled as I tried to walk by quickly.</p>
<p>As if his remark had been a command, I stopped and faced him. There was a momentary silence which I tried to break by saying something trivial but rational: I think I said something about boys their age being at home and in bed at such an hour. I don't remember just what I said because, as a matter of fact, I was frozen with fear. The other four boys nudged each other and snickered.</p>
<p>"You tell him, Bobo," one of them urged the boy near me. "Where do you live, Bobo?" I asked, now that I knew his name or nickname.</p>
<p>Bobo did not answer me at first. Then, in a drawl that was suddenly babyish, he articulated: "Mister, your wife, she is nice, mmm . . . "</p>
<p>The others laughed and encouraged him: "Tell him, Bobo; tell the jerk."</p>
<p>I lunged at Bobo. He leaped up a couple of stairs. The others rose and began descending slowly. Now all five confronted me and they looked vicious, their thin lips drawn back over their sharp teeth. I became fascinated by their teeth. They were not human teeth somehow, too small and too sharp and too evenly spaced. Though they snarled and revealed many teeth, there seemed to be no differentiation into canines and molars in their mouths; only narrow white lines, like unusually narrow band saws.</p>
<p>Now I was afraid as I had never been afraid in my life before. I did not act sensibly or bravely. I turned and began walking rapidly toward home. The gang was after me hissing obscene insults at me, at Dora, at Bobbie. I quickened my pace, I almost ran, and they after me. Strangely, there was no one else in sight, though only a few minutes earlier there had been some pedestrian traffic. Now the street was entirely deserted.</p>
<p>I was getting near home, but they were gaining on me. Then I felt the hand of one of them in my pocket. I turned on him and he retreated a couple of steps, but even as I faced him, torn by fury and fear, the others were upon me. I could feel their nasty panting breath. Their hands were in all my pockets, emptying them of their contents. But in the welter of hands all over me I became aware of something that sent a tide of still greater dread through me. One of the hands was not fumbling for coins-- instead it gingerly wormed its fingers along my groin.</p>
<p>Slowly I moved my eyes in the direction of the owner of that hand. It seemed a slow motion to me, as if I would never get to see the loathsome face. Actually it was probably a quick and spasmodic movement. Finally, after what appeared to be hours, my glance rested on his face. It was a pale and delicate oval of prurience. His little eyes gleamed with ecstasy, his narrow mouth was open around a circle of teeth; spittle dribbled from one corner. "M-i-s-t-e-r," he drawled.</p>
<p>I swung wildly. I hit one of the kids a glancing blow and, as in the assault on Do'ra, he collapsed to the sidewalk and began whimpering. The other four ran and disappeared with inexplicable speed, I could not tell where. There were no open doorways nearby so far as I could recall. Yet they vanished. I also shouted as I swung. It would perhaps be more cor­rect to say that I roared--a husky, choked bellow, as when a man awakens at the climax of a nightmare, the kind of cornered outcry whose volume it is impossible to judge. It might have been very loud or it might have merely resounded in my head and been no more than a muffled whisper out­side. No one heard me, apparently, for no windows were opened to see the cause of the disturbance and no one came running around the corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I stood over the crouched boy, instantly drained of anger and not knowing what to do. I could not identify him from among the five, now that his face had lost its uniquely vicious expression.</p>
<p>"Are you Bobo?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, I am Mick," he answered matter of factly.</p>
<p>"Who are the others?"</p>
<p>"They are mine friends,"--that's the way he said it, "mine friends."</p>
<p>I ordered him to get up and he obeyed. "What was the big idea?" I began gruffly. He stood with head bowed, a picture of contrite childhood. Instead of answering my question he complained: "You hit me; you, a big guy, hit me, and I'm only a boy." He seemed about to begin sniffling and I was overcome with guilt. What on earth had come over me? Why all this terror? Some nasty neighborhood brats no doubt, that's all--yet I actually hit a child, and I tried to hit him hard. It was only by chance that my blow glanced off his head.</p>
<p>Quickly, as if he had no weight, Mick leaped. He landed some feet away. At this safe distance his face resumed its prurient leer. "M-i-s­t-e-r!" A thin monotone of vicious laughter dripped from his mouth.</p>
<p>I ran like one possessed. Behind me his voice taunted: "M-i-s-t-e-r, your wife she has . . .</p>
<p>My face told on me when I entered the apartment. Dora looked at me once and jumped from her chair.</p>
<p>"Bill, the kids again!"</p>
<p>"Five of them," I said.</p>
<p>"What will we do?"</p>
<p>I did not answer. Instinctively we walked toward Bobbie's room. He was peacefully asleep. We tiptoed back into the living room. Dora sat down dispirited.</p>
<p>"Something terrible is happening," she remarked to no one in partic­ular.</p>
<p>"Something is happening," I said. "I don't know what."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By mid-July there was no longer any question about what was happening. New York was overwhelmed with swarms of kids—depraved and repulsive crea­tures that terrorized the entire population. Soon after our experiences early in June, it became known that hundreds of similar incidents had been occurring throughout the city. At first the victims refrained from report­ing these attacks to the police, and even avoided discussing them with friends because of their humiliating nature. Furthermore, when one tried to analyze an incident after it had occurred, to make a rational case of it, there seemed to be no real case. It was almost impossible to catch one of the kids at this time, and if one was caught he would cry and whimper, and it was obviously impossible to get rough with a child. The first few attempts to report the attacks to the police ended in ridicule for the plaintiffs. "So, a kid said something nasty to you, eh? Is that your complaint? Go on, Mister, go on home and don't bother us." Such were the first reactions of the police.</p>
<p>I recall a particular incident that happened early in June which nearly resulted in a lynching. A man and his thirteen-year-old daughter had been thus assaulted, and when the man pursued one of the offending kids who had made obscene remarks to the girl, the boy climbed up a lamp-post. A crowd quickly gathered. Most people had not yet had experiences with the kids then, and their anger against the man who had the gall to persecute an innocent and obviously underprivileged child of not more than ten years of age nearly resulted in mob violence against him. The police escorted the man and his daughter to safety and told him bluntly what they thought of his kind.</p>
<p>By mid-June such an incident was no longer possible. New York as a whole became aware of the problem of the kids. Their number increased mysteriously at a terrific rate from day to day. Now they roamed all parts of the city singly and in small groups, and their depredations grew in audacity. The press raised an alarm about the menace, but still blamed it on social conditions— ace tensions, slums, inadequate playground facil­ities and similar evils. It did not take long, however, before a shudder of dread ran through the entire eight million population of New York, and even the stodgiest newspapers lost their calm when dealing with the prob­lem and ceased pontificating knowingly. For countless people suddenly realized that this was not a normal problem. It was not a race problem—that was apparent at a glance. All the kids who wandered about in countless thousands had greyish-pale faces, indistinctly colored hair that was not quite blond nor yet dark, beady black eyes. There was not a fair one among them, nor a decidedly dark one. All were as if molded from dull paste. Similarly, nearly everyone was suddenly struck by the shock­ing realization that none of the kids seemed to have any kind of home or parents. At night their numbers decreased somewhat, or so it seemed to the few people who ventured outside. But the kids were never seen to enter a house. In the morning they were about again, more numerous than the day before, yet they were never seen emerging from a house. Nor was any of them ever seen with a parent or an older member of the family. When pursued, they vanished around corners or faded into previously unsuspected doorways. When followed around a corner, they were no longer there. For that matter, it was becoming increasingly difficult to know whether they had really vanished. There were so many of them around at this stage, and they all looked so much alike, that it was impossible to tell which group of kids one was looking at, the ones just pursued or an entirely different gang.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By the time everybody became thoroughly alarmed it no longer appeared possible to do anything about the infestation. There was a brief clamor for more police protection, but this subsided quickly. The police, too, were helpless. It was remarkable how the entire city seemed to surrender to the new situation without a struggle. The newspapers ceased writing scathing editorials against one thing or another as being responsible for the plague of kids. Instead they sent reporters to make a block by block count of the kids in a number of districts. Then they did a little fig­uring. The results were nonsensical. The count for all of New York, on the basis of the sample blocks, was well over two million kids by the end of June.</p>
<p>Where could two million children have appeared from? Surely, no one in 1958 any longer believed in spontaneous creation! It must all be a sick exaggeration of a hysterical state of mind, people commented without conviction.</p>
<p>But the kids were there nevertheless.</p>
<p>As the number of kids increased, their audacity mounted. They now extended their operations to raiding, and another strange feature of their behavior was noticed. The kids never carried any of their assaults through to logical completion. They attacked stores, but they took nothing for themselves. They merely scattered the fruit and vegetables and canned goods, the toys, clothing and hardware, on the sidewalks and jeered and made obscene remarks and gestures in the direction of the outraged owners. They assaulted men and women alike with their lecherous suggestions and insinuations, but no real physical violence was done. Their technique was one of wearing down their victims, of tormenting them and keeping them in their power. As their confidence mounted with their numbers, it became one of their favorite pranks for a gang of them to surround a man or a woman, to rip off their clothes and not let them escape, meanwhile pawing their victims and insulting them, until they would be rescued by groups of people.</p>
<p>New York reacted sluggishly and late. By the time the police received orders to round up the kids, there were far too many of them to be handled.</p>
<p>Some hundreds were picked up and locked up. The refused to answer ques­tions. They sere kept in prison for some days and then released. No information whatever had been gained.</p>
<p>Around this time people began walking about the streets in groups only, for greater protection, but the sidewalks were now crowded with kids, and walking down a street was like driving through a swarm of locusts that parted before the vehicle and closed again behind it. If the group was too small, it was attacked outright; and pitiful was the fate of an indi­vidual who dared out alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many acts of desperation were probably performed at this time. They were not reported. The city was too busy trying to cope with the problem to be interested in single incidents. All energies were taken up by the effort to follow accustomed routines. I know of one act of desperation because I was a party to it. This happened around mid-July. My neighbor, the dentist, two other men from the same building and I went out for a walk in the evening. We arranged to meet in the lobby before venturing outside—such had become our necessity. We walked down the street through the swarm of kids and their verbal assaults to which we had already become accustomed. We sat in the neighborhood cafeteria for a while. We felt a compulsion to talk, to discuss what to do, yet we said nothing on this sub­ject. The problem had no edges, nothing to grasp at for leverage. All we could do was to try to control our baffled fury. Consequently our remarks were casual and beside the point, as if nothing had happened and every­thing was normal. After a while we started back. For greater protection we walked in diamond formation. As we approached the house we saw three kids trying to open the door to the lobby. As if at a signal we rushed them. Two wriggled out of our hands. We had the third one. We dragged him in and locked the door behind us.</p>
<p>As usual, he squatted on the floor and whimpered. We paid no atten­tion to his whining. Two of us guarded the door to make sure that he would not flee. The other two stood over him. We did not know what to do with him. Our capture had been completely unplanned. Now each waited for the others to suggest what to do next. The dentist was the first to speak. He said: "We can't take him to any of our apartments."</p>
<p>We all agreed to this.</p>
<p>My restrained fury boiled over. "Let's take him downstairs, to the basement," I suggested. I had no idea what we would do with him in the basement, but a primeval instinct dictated to me: Take the quarry away to a secluded spot and then you will decide what to do with him. What did we want from the kid? Neither I nor the others knew. But the obvious first thing to do was to hide him in a spot where he could be handled with­out interference.</p>
<p>We dragged him down the stairs into the basement and took him past the laundry machines and the huge boiler to where there was a small area lit­tered with discarded and broken pieces of furniture. Nobody ever looked in that corner. There we set up our court. We shoved the kid into the angle formed by the two walls and we faced him.</p>
<p>"Now look here," the dentist began in a threatening tone.</p>
<p>"Wait," I interrupted him. "Let's be methodical. What's your name?" I asked the kid.</p>
<p>He stared at me blankly as if he didn't understand my question.</p>
<p>"Are you Bobo or Mick or who are you?"</p>
<p>Though I had suggested calm to the dentist, my voice already trem­bled with frenzy.</p>
<p>"I didn't do nothing," the boy began whimpering.</p>
<p>"Never mind what you did," I hissed at him. "Are you Bobo?" "My name is Lags," he said wiping his eyes.</p>
<p>"Lags!" I screamed, "What the hell kind of name is that? Now you answer honestly or . . ." and I shook my fist in his pale face.</p>
<p>"My name is Lags, and I didn't do nothing; I'm only a kid and I want to go." He said this as if reciting a memorized routine. I shook with anger and could say nothing more. The dentist resumed the interrogation.</p>
<p>"Where do you live?"</p>
<p>"I live with mine friends."</p>
<p>"Where the hell is that?" he, too, lost his temper.</p>
<p>"I live with mine friends and I didn't do nothing," the boy repeated weepily.</p>
<p>The four of us retreated a step to hold a council of war. "It's no use," I suggested.</p>
<p>"We are on the wrong track," the dentist said firmly. "This is our chance and, damn it, let's make the most of it. I suggest we use rough stuff. These damn kids don't breed from thin air. They come from some­place; they live somewhere. He is one of them. I say let's find out if we have to do things that, well, that we wouldn't normally do."</p>
<p>"You mean, torture a child?" one of the others exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Cut it out," the dentist silenced him. "You know very well these aren't children. The devil knows what they are. Don't make things more difficult than they already are. You are not the only civilized man here."</p>
<p>We nodded our agreement and returned to the kid. The dentist addressed himc: "Now look here, Lags, or whatever your name is. I am a dentist. Do you know what a dentist is?"</p>
<p>The boy looked at him blankly, his face immobile.</p>
<p>"A dentist pulls teeth. Now you answer our questions or I will pull your rotten little teeth out, right here and now. Where do you live?"</p>
<p>"I live with mine friends," he clung to his story.</p>
<p>"Where do your friends live? What street is that on?"</p>
<p>"We live together, and if you come with me I will show you," the kid said with some alacrity.</p>
<p>Slowly and threateningly the dentist began rolling up his sleeves.</p>
<p>"All right, I warned you," he said. "You are not so small a boy that you don't understand me. I don't even know if you are a boy or an old man. There's no telling about you kids. But you do know what's what. So now I'll make you talk. Get this straight, Lags, I'm asking you for the very last time to tell me where you live, and don't give me any more of that 'with mine friends' stuff."</p>
<p>He approached the boy and grabbed his arm fiercely. His hand con­tracted on the thin arm and began squeezing. The kid started crying bit­terly, "You're hurting me! Let go! I'm only a boy!"</p>
<p>The dentist did not relax his grip. The rest of us stood by tensely. The boy turned to us and appealed: "Don't let him do it! He's hurting me!"</p>
<p>I alternately clenched and opened my fists; the two others were doing the same. The boy's face showed signs of his anguish. I could no longer restrain myself and cried out: "Let go of him."</p>
<p>The dentist's hand relaxed its hold. The signs of anguish disappeared from the kid's face; a suggestion of the familiar leer began to play on it.</p>
<p>We had not noticed it before, but there was a small window in the wall near the boiler. It was on the level of the pavement in back of the house. It probably had been used as a coal chute years ago before the building converted to oil. We suddenly became aware of it now when we saw a faint light flickering behind it. The kid, too, noticed it and his temper changed instantaneously. "You jerks," he spat at us, "that's Chief coming to get me out."</p>
<p>We were petrified. "Who's Chief?"</p>
<p>"He's one of mine friends. I live with him."</p>
<p>All his fear and whimpering were gone. He was one of the kids again. We listened to the scratchings outside the soot-covered window. Some kids were trying to pry it open. We ran upstairs not daring to look behind. The kids had forced the window open and we heard them pouring in.</p>

<p>The exodus from New York began about mid-July. It began unostenta­tiously. People did not talk about leaving the city. One here and one there simply packed up and left, often without even telling friends about it in advance. The movement outward gained rapid momentum and by the end of July the flight was an accepted fact. Now people left in groups, just as they walked in the streets in groups. One would say, "Tomorrow?" and the others would nod; the following morning they would toss a few things together and leave. The fugitives had no definite destination. The only thing that mattered was to be away. Somewhere beyond the Hudson it was safe. Somewhere to the North it was safe. But there were no distinct borders to the region of safety. At first some letters were received from the fugitives: These were brief. The fugitives went some distance, then they would stop in some city for a while, and then move on again. Sur­prisingly, none of them mentioned the presence or absence of kids outside New York. They were well, they wrote, and they were glad they had gone. From the tone of the letters one might have thought they had left the city because of a spell of bad weather; only the "Wish you were here" was lack­ing. But the letters did contain a suggestion of forlornness and general indecision what to do from then on.</p>
<p>The trickle of letters from the fugitives rapidly diminished. This may have been due to their undetermined state of mind, but it was chiefly cut down by a more immediate factor. As the kids continued to swarm and the number of people in the city diminished, mail delivery became very irregular. There was a shortage of postmen. The ones still on duty feared to make their rounds unescorted. The kids attacked them, grabbed the mail from their hands, opened the letters then and there and read from them imaginary obscene messages. Mail delivery was temporarily organized by means of guarded vehicles, mail trucks stopping at each individual house. Soon even this proved unfeasible and almost no mail got through.</p>
<p>People were also less and less interested in letters. The exodus mood seized the entire city and everyone viewed his own departure as simply a matter of time, not much time at that. What did it matter what news letters could bring? Any news from "there" was good, as long as one was away from the kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The kids sensed the new situation. They now behaved as if they owned the city. They entered houses at will wherever they could find an open door or window. They knew they would meet with no resistance. Their num­ber had increased so prodigiously that there could be no talk of resistance.</p>
<p>Each morning a huge traffic jam formed at the entrances to the tunnels and the George Washington Bridge. The cars trying to get over or under the Hudson backed up for miles. This gave the kids an added incentive.</p>
<p>They seemed to derive particular satisfaction from tormenting the fugitives. As the miles of cars were stalled bumper to bumper, the kids clambered over them, sticking their foul faces into the open windows. They hung on to the doors. They climbed onto the hoods. They peeked through the rear windows and there was no escaping them or shooing them away. Each day they clung to the cars a little farther along the route. They followed them into the tunnels and onto the bridges.</p>
<p>During one of the last days of July, there occurred a small incident that accelerated the exodus. It was an exceptionally hot morning and the traffic jam Was unusually heavy. As the drivers crept through the tunnels, contending against the stuffiness and the kids, one of the drivers suc­cumbed to his panic. As he approached the exit his endurance gave way and he stepped on the gas pedal and sped by the toll gate without stopping, in an effort to shake off the kids. He was successful. When he looked back the kids were gone. He sped on, and the drivers behind him, catching the contagious panic, followed after him without stopping at the toll gates. It became a tidal movement that could not be stopped. The next day the toll gates were not reopened. The flight was out of control. Mechanical counters were installed to keep track of the number of cars.</p>
<p>One newspaper made a final spot check of kids in a few blocks. The resulting figure was astronomic. Judging by their density in the blocks counted, there were nearly eight million kids in New York. It didn't make sense. Nothing made sense. The only thing left to do was to flee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is now mid-September. Dora, Bobbie and I are staying in a fugi­tives' camp at the foot of the Winona Hills. There are about one thousand families in this camp. We fled for thirteen hundred miles until we crossed the Mississippi, then we came to a halt. Most of us live in our cars. A few have acquired trailers along the way. Some bought tents which they pitched on the flat ground near the river. It is beautiful country. The Mississippi is a vast network of channels here. To the East we see the sun rise over the hills of Wisconsin. Before us are the Winona bluffs. The woods are now beginning to change color and there are bright patches of red sumach and yellowing elms. We shop in Winona. Some families have built ovens in camp and the women take turns at cooking and baking. The ducks are migrating South and many of them stop for a while along the num­erous sandy islands overgrown with cottonwood trees. We shoot many of them. The fishing in the river is good, -and from neighboring farms we get vegetables and milk at reasonable prices. But the nights are becoming chilly. We do not talk about our situation. We are all disturbed about the future, but since our predicament is so strange and incomprehensible, we do not talk about it.</p>
<p>Other parties of fugitives drive by our camp from time to time. Some of them left New York before us but had stopped on the way farther East. Others left New York after us. We ask them for news. They speak little. They are beaten people—even more beaten than we. When they do talk they tell of incomprehensible horrors. After we left it became even more difficult to flee New York. The kids interfered. Their gangs would stop in front of cars and prevent them from proceeding. Pedestrians were at their mercy altogether. Now that only some hundreds of thousands of peo­ple are left in the city, they are completely at the mercy of the kids who have them in their power and practice upon them all kinds of unspeak­ably obscene orgies.</p>
<p>We listen to these disconnected tales and shake our heads. It is so far away that it sounds unbelievable and unreal, though from our own ex­perience, we have grounds to believe the reports. Occasionally we ask these travellers where they intend to go. They can give no clear answers. "A stretch more," they say vaguely, and drive on.</p>
<p>Yesterday I looked my car over carefully. I don't know why I did it. These days I am afraid to examine my motives and intentions too closely.</p>
<p>I discovered that the brake drum was completely shot and the transmission in bad shape. I had noticed some trouble during the last lap of the trip. Now I knew that the car was useless.</p>
<p>This morning the importance of the condition of my car was brought home to me. Suddenly a rumor spread that one of the kids had been seen in camp. Who had seen him? Nobody could tell. But the rumor quickly spread throughout the camp which stretches for some miles along the river. At once unease seized the encampment and there was much feverish packing and checking of cars. Later the rumor was denied. The boy in question had indeed looked like one of the kids, but it was established that he was an ordinary boy whose parents camped some distance away. By noon the rumor was renewed. The boy had claimed a family as his own but when he was confronted with that family, it was proved that he did not belong to it, and he bolted into the woods. Nobody knows what to make of the contra­dictory rumor's, but the packing and getting ready is in full swing.</p>
<p>Dora stands before me and begs: "Bill, let's go." Bobbie seconds her.</p>
<p>"We have no brakes," I say. "The car is shot, no brakes and a busted transmission."</p>
<p>"Daddy, let's go from here," Bobbie begs.</p>
<p>I put my hand on his shoulder to calm him. His entire body is trem­bling.</p>
<p>"Then we'll walk," Dora pleads,</p>
<p>We look into each other's eyes and understand. Where shall we go?</p>
