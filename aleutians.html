    <h1>The Aleutians</h1>
    <p>For the past four years a huge neon sign on the empty lot opposite my house has been proclaiming in red, amber and blue:</p>
    <center>
<p class=cent>THE ALEUTIANS</p>
<p class=cent>Marvelous Mad Musical Melodrama</p>
<p class=cent>Based on the Battle of Attu</p>
<p class=cent>You must See This Epic of the Rat Islands</p>
<p class=cent><i>It Will Give You the Williwaws</i></p>
<p>Whether this musical comedy actually gave anyone the williwaws has never been proved. It is not even quite clear what "having the williwaws" means. One thing is certain— it has not "given the williwaws" to anyone for the past two years, and this for a very simple reason. No one has seen this musical during these two years, though it is being produced nightly, as well as on Wednesday and Sunday afternoons, in one of the big­gest theatres in New York.</p>
<p>Nor is this the only strange thing about this amazing play that has already effected such profound changes in our lives and that seems about to revolutionize international affairs to an unheard of extent. It may even bring about the world unity for which mankind has been hoping for many centuries. In the field of economics this unity will be attained within a very short time. It is still a secret known only to a handful of the initiated, but I think I will be forgiven if I reveal that very soon, any day now, gold, the dollar, the franc and probably even the ruble will go the way of wampum, pressed tea bricks, the shekel and similar units of exchange and will be replaced by the OS as the international unit of value. What is an OS and what does it have to do with the musical comedy The Aleutians? it will no doubt be asked.</p>
<p>In revealing this financial secret I have run ahead of myself. It is therefore perhaps best that I tell in an orderly manner the strange and amazing story of the mysterious and powerful influence this play has had on this country and on the world at large. It will sound incredible, I know, but the facts are irrefutable, and for the benefit of later generations here they are.</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to recount the plot of The Aleutians. Everyone is by now familiar at least with the gist of this musical comedy. Indeed, there is little that is original or worthy of note about the plot, which concerns an American soldier on Attu who gets cut off from his unit during the famous battle for possession of that island. As he wanders among the mountains, half starved, nearly frozen and in constant dread of encountering Japanese soldiers, he comes upon the opening into a cave. He enters it and there finds an Aleut girl who befriends him, falls in love with him, makes him forget the battle and everything else, makes him fall in love with her, etc., etc., all in good musical comedy style. The two lovers are finally discovered some time later by a detail of American soldiers assigned to police up the island after the battle. In a crescendo of triumphant love the happy pair stand dramatically outlined in the entrance of the cave, the detail of soldiers picturesquely and effectively distri­buted on various rocks and ledges below them, and the Aleut girl sings the refrain of the song which has swept around the world and is hummed even in the most remote islands, the song which bids fair to become the hymn of the new international federation of mankind: </p>
<p>"Willie, will you waw,</p>
<p>Or naw . . . . "</p>
<p>The remaining words of this song are too well known to be repeated here.</p>
<p>Stupid? Of course it is a stupid plot and a ridiculous song. The face remains, however, that this stupid musical comedy and this embarras­sing song have affected the country in an inexplicable manner from the night of the premiere. We are therefore not free to ignore it, whatever our personal reactions to it may be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is one fact relating to this musical comedy which is known to very few people and which may help explain the phenomenal, nay, miraculous, hold which it has exerted. It concerns how this play came to be written.</p>
<p>The author of The Aleutians had himself served in the battle of Attu. In the course of the fighting he killed a Japanese soldier in hand-to-hand combat. This incident seemed to make no particular impression upon him at the time and he later thought that he had forgotten it. But after he was discharged from the army he became afflicted with a strange form of hallu­cination. He experienced the act of killing the Japanese soldier over and over. This hallucination at first appeared only once or twice a day at irregular intervals. It would come to him as he walked in the street or ate in a restaurant or talked to friends. There were one or two factors about these hallucinations which lent them special power. The light about the phantom was very bright and of such intensity that every minute detail acquired unusual vividness. Also, the incident was always re-enacted in slow motion. The author had killed the Japanese soldier with what is known in army manuals as a "vertical butt stroke number one." The actual inci­dent lasted but a fraction of a second. It was resorted to unexpectedly and was completed before the author had any clear realization of what he was doing. It was a mechanical, physical reaction spontaneously performed as a consequence of long training. But in the hallucination this act of half a second's duration would be protracted over a minute or more. The Japanese soldier would appear before the autor, immobile, grinning the conventional caricature of a toothy Japanese grin. Slowly the author would swing the butt of his rifle and with agonizing slowness the face of the Japanese soldier would disintegrate and almost languidly he would fall to the ground. Then he would rise again, grin once more, and the hallucination would dissolve.</p>
<p>At first the author ascribed his malady to the tensions of readjust­ment to civilian life. He also tried to explain it as a belated manifes­tation of fatigue or even of shock. He therefore hoped that with the pass­ing months the hallucinations would appear less frequently and finally vanish altogether.</p>
<p>But it did not work out this way. Instead of diminishing, the fre­quency of the hallucinations increased at an alarming rate. Within a very few months the Japanese victim of the author's successful butt stroke became his constant companion, scarcely leaving him for a minute. The grinning phantom followed him wherever he went and every few minutes performed the act of being killed, only to rise again and accompany his erstwhile executioner.</p>
<p>When things had reached this pass, the author confided this strange malady to friends and they recommended him to a prominent psychiatrist. The latter at once became interested in the strange case and after probing for some weelth various phases of the author's subconscious, he analyzed the situation as follows. The author, who had been a free-lance journalist until then, the psychiatrist said, was suffering from a heavy burden of guilt. This guilt was not to be associated with the killing of the Japanese soldier, since this was done in the heat of battle as an involuntary act of self-defence. The guilt obsession had much deeper roots and was to be linked with the dropping of the atom bombs and the consequent fear or retribution. This guilt, the psychiatrist maintained, lay deep below the level of consciousness of the entire nation. There was no explaining why the author, alone among one hundred and sixty million other Americans, had become its conscious victim. The solution lay in sharing it with the rest of the population and in this way relieving himself of this burden alto­gether, or at least reducing it to its proper proportion, that is, to bear only one hundred and sixty millionth part of the guilt. The psychiatrist therefore recommended that, since the client was in the writing profession, he should try to rid himself of the internal pressure of guilt which resulted in the hallucination by means of writing something—a novel, a play, a poem, any form of literary outpouring—based on his experiences on Attu.</p>
<p>The author tried to comply with this advice. For some weeks he sought an appropriate literary form. He decided to write about how he killed the Japanese soldier, how he and the other men of his squad clambered through icy mud and over boulders in an effort to mop up one of the least accessi­ble parts of the island, how this Japanese soldier suddenly seemed to materialize before him out of nowhere, the swing of the rifle butt through a vertical arc, the horror of the scene and all the rest of it. He felt that he must be very dramatic in his description, that he must convey horror, revulsion, fear, relief at the sight of the dead and harmless enemy. But no matter how he approached the subject, he failed. The re­sulting lines not only had a false ring, they also seemed pointless.</p>
<p>He was on the verge of giving up the attempt. One evening he sat at his desk glancing with a sense of distaste at some of the pages he had written. The Japanese phantom that had been haunting him was standing nearby in its usual pose of servile acquiescence. He dropped the pages with a gesture of disgust, the last word still on the tip of his tongue: "williwaw." It was late. He felt very tired and light-headed. "Willie, will you waw?" he addressed the phantom facetiously. The Japanese ghost nodded assent. "Or naw . . .?" he continued querying him. The phantom grinned and moved a few steps away where he remained indistinct.</p>
<p>"That almost sounds like the refrain to a particularly revolting popular song," the author said to himself. But the phrase stuck like a burr and he could not shake it off. Out of sheer weariness and indiffer­ence he wrote it down. The remaining lines, now so universally known, followed almost automatically.</p>
<p>When he finished the four stanzas he felt strangely relieved.</p>
<p>"Well, if I wasn't crazy before, I am now," he said to himself as he reread the lyric. But he did not feel the least troubled about this possibility. He laughed at the absurdity of the lines.</p>
<p>"Come here, Willie," he beckoned to the phantom.</p>
<p>The ghost of the Japanese soldier obediently stepped forward grin­ning. The author read the stanzas to it.</p>
<p>"All right, Willie, now give me your honest opinion about this," he said.</p>
<p>The phantom continued grinning for a while, then, for the first time in many weeks, slowly dissolved and vanished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The script of the comedy was written in one week. The writing required no effort whatever. It was vulgar and absurd; the author was aware of this. Originally he had set himself much higher standards. But as long as the words kept pattering from under the typewriter keys, he chose not to be critical. What difference did it make? Obviously he could not comply with the psychiatrist's suggestion. He had tried to write seriously on the subject of his experiences in Attu and had failed. If this comedy that was taking shape almost automatically could be a source of so much amusement, why not proceed with it to the end? While he was writing one line he had no idea what the next would be. It was more like copying a play than writing one. But it provided much giddy amusement, and even as he wrote he frequently laughed uproariously, even hysterically.</p>
<p>The phantom which had been pursuing him now often stood unobtrusively in a corner as if anxious not to interfere. It had stopped going through the motions of being killed and even absented itself for prolonged periods. The author was scarcely aware of this, he was so engrossed in the foolish yet mad unraveling of the comedy. Whenever he became conscious of the phantom he would greet him with what had become a set formula: "Well, Willie, will you waw?" and the phantom would step forward and nod pleasantly.</p>
<p>The author of The Aleutians had no intention of marketing the play. He did not think it merited serious consideration. But shortly after com­pleting it he read it, more or less as light entertainment, to some friends.</p>
<p>The effect was indescribable. "You must have it produced," they insisted unanimously. 'But it's only trivial nonsense!" he protested. They would not listen to him, and since he refused to do anything about it, they undertook to bring it to the attention of producers. The effect of the play on the very first producer was like that on the first small audience. The play was bought, a contract signed, a cast engaged; an unusual number of angels vied for the privilege of financing the production.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Little more need be said about the author. The writing of The Aleutians had the desired effect on him. The hallucinations ceased. And, strangely, despite the unbelievable success of his play, his name is barely remembered, except in limited professional circles. He is said to pass his time rather enjoyably on the extensive ranch he acquired in New Mexico.</p>
<p>The premiere of The Aleutians provided proof that there was something out of the ordinary, something almost abnormal, about this comedy which, in every other respect, was no more than a piece of irrelevant nonsense. Not only did the critics without exception acclaim it as great, stupendous, marvelous. The unexampled response of the audience set sober-minded people to speculating on the mysterious power of this musical comedy. Hardly fif­teen minutes had passed after the rising of the curtain when the audience, which on that first night did not even fill the theatre, began showing signs of a strange and contagious elation. They did not applaud the actors or in any other way show direct approval of the comedy. But a sudden gaiety and friendliness swept over the auditorium. People turned and nodded to each other cheerfully. Those who sat alone or in twos moved toward the more densely-seated parts of the theatre. Within a few minutes the entire audience was closely packed in front of the stage. The embarrassingly foolish theme song was at once caught up and became a form of salutation and an introductory remark to conversation. "Will you waw?" people asked each other, and these meaningless words were said with so much gladness, so much pure delight, as if they were the happiest tidings one could impart. The conventional orderliness of a theatre performance disappeared. There was the sound of blithe conversation on all sides. But the actors appeared not to mind it. Actors and audience became as one. The light prattle of comedy seemed to fit into the gay hubbub in the auditorium; the two comple­mented each other and fused into one outpouring of childish, undiluted joy. During the final scene of triumphant love the entire audience rose and, having learned the words of the song from its rendition earlier in the play, accompanied the Aleut girl on the stage. But they did not so much sing the song as recite it. Few in the audience faced the stage at this point. They continued facing and talking to each other and the refrain "Will you waw" sounded like a joyous farewell at a happy parting that was also an intima­tion of an early and happy reunion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fame of the new musical comedy spread like a prairie fire. Each night the theatre was filled beyond capacity and at first hundreds, and later thousands, had to be turned away from the doors. For those who had seen The Aleutians it became a landmark in their lives and they counted time in rela­tion to this event rather than by the calendar. Thus people would say: iMy aunt from Cincinnati arrived a week before I saw The Aleutians," or, "I broke my leg three weeks after I saw The Aleutians."</p>
<p>Those who had seen the play underwent a subtle change. It was not merely that they were more cheerful after they had seen it. There was a certain self-confidence about them, a sense of assurance and inner peace that lent a power of conviction to all they said and did. Thus it was noted by keen observers a short time after the play was produced that those who had seen it seldom praised it very highly or urged their friends very strongly to see it. They would merely mention having seen it, and the person thus informed would be overcome with a great urgency to see the comedy, like a starving person who is told where good food is to be obtained without effort or cost. It was likewise observed that those who had seen the play seldom showed any particular desire to see it a second time. They appeared to be content, even satiated. Their one attendance which worked the mysterious change in them sufficed; at least it sufficed for the four years since the musical had had its premiere.</p>
<p>As the months passed and the rage to see The Aleutians swept to the most remote corners of the country, a few discerning persons began to grasp that here was more than the usual "hit." Like all sensitive persons of great discernment they did not rush to see musical comedies. By the time their interest had been aroused and some of them became curious to see The Aleutians, it was already difficult to obtain a ticket. They were perplexed by the eerie power of such a trivial production, and although unable to find fault with its effects, they wondered and even worried. They, too, could not suppress a gleeful response to the theme song of the comedy. But when they caught themselves humming happily "Willie, will you waw," they were disturbed. One of them, a noted theatre critic, correspondent, poet and novelist, wrote a deeply moving article entitled "What is Happening to Us?" and this was published in the magazine section of the Sunday Times and later reprinted in nearly every major newspaper in the country. But keen critic though he was, even he could not probe the depths of the mysterious influence of the play, and he concluded with a vague warning that "something strange is happening to the people who see this play which, though not apparently harmful in itself, is a symptom of abnormal, mysterious and disturbing proclivities on the part of the population as a whole which would best be examined carefully and acted upon before the entire nation has lost its emotional stability."</p>
<p>Despite this warning by such a noted personage, the career of The Aleutians remained unaffected. The crowds that streamed to its doors kept growing larger. People came to the box office begging for tickets in any part of the theatre six months or even as much as a year in advance. But although the box office remained open, such supplicants were treated with jeers and lightly concealed contempt. They wanted tickets? Where did they live? In the Brazilian Jungle? Didn't they know that no tickets were available at all for years to come? Few had hopes of obtaining any, never­theless a line formed every morning before the ticket office and no one would depart until he had had his own brief and unpleasant interview at the ticket window.</p>
<p>It was easy enough to discover how tickets for The Aleutians had been sold out so far in advance. Almost from the very beginning speculators moved onto the scene and the price of tickets on the black market skyrocketed. An attempt was made to reserve a certain proportion of tickets for the box office, but as a result of collusion between the speculators and the pro­ducers this effort was defeated. The public, too, in its urgent eagerness to see the musical, helped defeat this attempt, for people did not care to take a chance on obtaining a ticket through legitimate channels and were willing to pay fabulous sums to speculators rather than risk not seeing the comedy.</p>
<p>From all corners of the country people of means flocked to New York for the sole purpose of seeing The Aleutians. In most instances they failed in their quest, but upon returning to their home towns they were generally ashamed to admit that they had spent hundreds of dollars in vain. In every city and town one could therefore soon find people who claimed to have see The Aleutians. These praised the play and urged their neighbors to see it even if they were the only people who praised the play, since the ones who had seen it felt no need to say anything in its favor.</p>
<p>During the second year of the production of The Aleutians things reached an absurd pass. A rumor became current—no doubt instigated by the speculators—that tickets for the play would be honored at any time and need not be used on the day for which they were issued. This led to strange results. Many people who had spent large sums for their tickets controlled their eagerness to see the play and, sensing opportunity, hoarded them in hopes of realizing a profit on their investment. Some also reasoned that some time after they had profitably disposed of their own tickets a satura­tion point would be reached and they would have a chance to see the comedy at the usual rates.</p>
<p>The long lines that used to form before the box office also dwindled gradually as people finally began to lose all hope. "What is the use?" they said. "It's such a wonderful play that it is hopeless to expect to get into the theatre." And they comforted themselves with playing a record of "Willie, will you waw."</p>
<p>In the upper rows of the balcony empty seats began to appear during the performances. The number of these seats increased with each passing week as the black market prices continued to soar and patrons as well as speculators hoarded their tickets.</p>
<p>Exactly two years after the premiere of The Aleutians the cast played before an entirely empty house.</p>
<p>But though the theatre remained empty the performances were carried out on schedule because holders of the tickets had a valid claim on the entertainment. Each month a new batch of tickets would be printed and released, only to be seized immediately by the speculators. By this time no dates were printed on the tickets any longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the third year there occurred that sad and memorable event which led to the setting up of a perimeter of one hundred yards of barbed wire barricade about the theatre building. In commenting on that event the New York Daily Journal rightly entitled its editorial remarks: "Bloody Sunday." The story of that fateful day, how a discontented and impatient mob of many thousands suddenly appeared at the theatre just before the matinee performance, is well known. Someone in the mob pointed to another person and cried out: "He's a speculator! It's people like him that keep us from seeing The Aleutians!" The man accused was dispatched without delay, and in the ensuing rush seventeen persons were trampled to death. The sudden appearance of that huge mob without any apparent reason or provocation was in itself a riddle that has remained unsolved to this day.</p>
<p>It was then that the authorities took a hand in the matter. A Com­mission was appointed to investigate the riot as well as all the other baffling aspects of this strange musical comedy. The barbed wire cordon was set up. No one except members of the cast and employees were permitted to enter the theatre, but performances were ordered continued as usual.</p>
<p>The more farreaching conclusions of the study made by the Commission have been suggested at the beginning of this account. Considering the strange hold of the comedy on the minds of the people, its fame which has spread to the ends of the earth, and the fact that tickets to its perform­ances are treasured above all else, the Commission invited prominent leaders from other countries to share in its deliberations. The following decisions were adopted. The printing and ownership of tickets to The Aleutians is to be taken over by an international body to be known as the International Aleutian Cartel. These tickets are to become the standard unit of exchange for all the world and the basis of all currencies. The OS, the Orchestra Seat, is to be the unit of countries with highly developed industries. The BAS, or Balcony Seats, are to serve more backward and agricultural countries. In order to provide an adequate supply of such tickets to meet the needs of international trade, the Cartel is to license many thousands of theatres in every country in the world to produce The Aleutians. Appropriate dra­matic schools are to be established to train the required actors and their understudies. The performances are to be held nightly everywhere, but, obviously, no audiences are to be admitted since the presence of a specta­tor would mean the consumption of an OS or a BAS, and the Cartel definitely prohibits the consumption, or destruction in some other wise, of a unit of exchange. In this manner many millions of OS's and BAS's are to be pro­duced nightly, and these are to be held in trust by the Cartel on behalf of the cooperating governments.</p>
<p>The plans for the dramatic schools and the theatres are already in the blueprint stage. Soon the entire world will be apprized of the program. Information from reliable sources reveals that publication of this plan is temporarily delayed pending the consent of the governments of Guatemala and Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such is the strange story of the musical comedy The Aleutians. I look at the huge neon sign in the empty lot across the street and my mind still cannot become reconciled to the unbelievable sequence of events. Who would have dreamed that a mere musical comedy would accomplish in a brief four years what neither war nor diplomacy could achieve in centuries--the first step toward world unity:</p>
<p>But even as I thus wonder there comes over the radio the lilting refrain: "Willie, will you waw/Or naw . . . " And though I have not seen the play, the mere recorded transmission of this song sets up within me moods and stirrings of a kind I have never experienced before, so that I think I am on the brink of understanding its wonderful redeeming force.</p>
