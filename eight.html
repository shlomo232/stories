    <h1>Eight Out of Ten</h1>
<p>"As you were saying, it's all a question of adjustment. I quite agree with you there," George remarked, absent-mindedly shaking the long ash from his cigar.</p>
<p>I hadn't said a word about adjustment. As a matter of fact I hadn't said anything at all the previous five minutes. With George around one doesn't have a chance to say very much. His mind is always obsessed with some idea which he tries to prove with instances from life. He is usually so wrapped up in his particular idea of the moment that he assumes whoever is with him shares the workings of his mind. It was obvious now that he was overcome by a new idea and I preferred not to correct him.</p>
<p>We were sitting in a cafeteria in a side street in New York when George made his remark about adjustment. George is a strange person. No one knows how he earns his livelihood, and though I have known him for a good many years, his visible sources of income appear to be none--any others he keeps a secret even from his best friends. Periodically he vanishes and nobody knows where he disappears to. Then he reappears again. He does not call on his friends, but he habitually haunts a certain part of the city so that one inevitably meets him when he returns from wherever he goes on his mysterious journeys. He seldom speaks of himself. His forte is human nature for which he has an unqualified contempt. I encountered him after one of his more prolonged absences and we went into this cafeteria to chat for a while. But it was evident from the beginning that he was wrestling with some new idea for he was absent-minded, scarcely paid any attention to me, and seemed to try to reconcile himself to something improbable.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, addressing no one in particular, "adjustment is the thing. And I don't mean adjustment to circumstances, making the best of a bad situation. I mean values, You know. One thing is important to you or to me yet it makes no sense to somebody else; on the other hand, some­thing that appears to be perfect nonsense to us is salvation for another person."</p>
<p>He paused a while and I could see he was organizing his thoughts for an attempt to prove his point.</p>
<p>"That's old stuff, George, everybody knows it; relativity, you know what I mean," I said merely to be sociable, but he seemed not to hear me. There was no getting away from it. He evidently had a story to illustrate his new insight into the question of adjustment. I liked George. Every­body liked George. I decided to let him get it off his chest. Besides, I knew that his deep, yet forgiving contempt for human nature frequently led him to observe traits of human behavior not noticed by others.</p>
<p>He fell into a reverie which lasted a few minutes, then he suddenly exclaimed, "Take Carl for instance!" as if that proved his point.</p>
<p>"What about Carl?" I said. "Who's Carl anyway?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you don't know Carl? Of course not. An old friend of mine. Hadn't seen him for a long time, and then, a couple of days ago, I ran into him again, in a shooting gallery."</p>
<p>"In a shooting gallery," I couldn't help laughing. "I didn't know you went in for that kind of stuff, and you an old infantry man too."</p>
<p>George glowered. "Never mind what I was doing in a shooting gallery." Then his voice softened: "There is more to it than meets the eye," he said, looking off into space.</p>
<p>I didn't press the matter. Considering his generally strange behavior, frequent unaccounted-for disappearances and lack of any known business or trade, all of George's friends had always made it a point not to pry into his affairs. Who could tell what strange transaction had made him visit a shooting gallery.</p>
<p>George was silent. I waited for him to resume. Whatever there was to this Carl, it evidently had made a deep impression on George. Only a little patience was needed and he would tell his story. He would not have mentioned Carl if he had not intended telling about him. I did not have to wait long.</p>
<p>"Carl and I shared a room once," George began quietly. "That was many years ago, during the depression. He was working at the time; I wasn't. I used to see a lot of him, evenings and so. He was a very nice fellow, quiet and reserved and kind. He helped me out whenever he could. Oh, nothing much, you know; he didn't have much himself. But-he'd pay for my coffee or buy me a beer and now and then slip me a quarter or a half. Living in the same room, and with Carl at home nearly every evening, I got to know him very well. I knew practically everything that was happening to him at that time.</p>
<p>  "A quiet, gentle, shy fellow like that - should have known something would happen to him of the sort that did happen. Yes, he went and fell in love with some dame working in the same office with him. I say 'he went and fell in love'. It was in the cards, premeditated almost, you might say. And what I mean in love! He was so mad about the girl he couldn't think of anything else. Sharing the same room as we did, I naturally found out about it very soon.</p>
<p>"And did he suffer. It was a pity to look at him. Moping all the time. Yet before that, he had always been one of the cheerfullest people you could wish to meet. A sunny disposition, It's a gift. You have it or you don't; that's all there is to it. Well, Carl had it.</p>
<p>"But that was before this bad break happened to him. After that he remained just as generous as he had ever been. He'd buy me a sandwich, and pay for my beer and let me have a few cents now and then. He was only making about twenty a week himself. But he turned morose. You couldn't get a word out of him with a pair of pliers after he became . . . emotionally involved, as you literary people would say."</p>
<p>I let it pass without comment. George always had liked to take a poke at my literary efforts.</p>
<p>"He'd sit there in the room evenings, just moping, or he'd grab his coat and run away as if his shirt was on fire. 'Where are you going, Carl?' I'd say, and he'd only mutter, 'Just going for a walk,' 'Wait, I'll go along with you,' I'd maybe say. But he wouldn't let me. 'I want to go alone,' and he'd rush out.</p>
<p>"I was getting worried. You know, I was young and cynical and all that, but this fellow was obviously in misery and I had gotten to like him after living with him for a while. Nights he would toss around and talk wild in his sleep. He never used to do it before. So the next time he said he wanted to go for a walk alone, I followed him. I did it a number of times. The way the poor dope was feeling, I was afraid he might try to do something desperate. People are peculiar creatures and you never can tell what they may not be up to. But Carl really meant what he said. He just went walking. He was pretty aimless about it, going up an avenue then turning into some crosstown street then down another avenue. But you should have seen him walk! As if somebody were chasing him. So after a while I gave up following him around. What's the use shadowing a crazy guy! But all the same my heart ached for him. I knew I'd never behave that way just on account of a dame and I wasn't justifying him. But many people are crazy about all sorts of things, so I wasn't surprised about Carl, and, as I said, he was a nice guy, and normally far from being a fool.</p>
<p>"I got to see the girl once. Carl and I were walking down the street one evening. All of a sudden I noticed he was getting tense. A group of four young people walked by us, three fellows and a girl. Carl nodded and said hello to them. He hardly turned his head. They were the only ones for some distance so I got a good look at her. You know how it is. When there are some men and one girl in your way, you notice the girl more than the others.</p>
<p>"I asked Carl what he was so excited about and he told me that was the girl and that she was engaged to be married to one of the fellows in, that group.</p>
<p>"Then I was convinced that he was crazy. You'd think a broad would have to be something special for a nice guy like Carl to carry on so about her, when there are hundreds of others right on the same block. But, I am telling you, I saw her and she didn't look a bit better than a million others. She was cute all right, the dark kind, black hair and brown eyes and shapely after a fashion, but . . . I'd seen any number of others just as good looking and I never went off the deep end like that.</p>
<p>"I didn't way anymore to Carl that night because I saw how upset he was. But I made up my mind to have a talk with him and set him straight. I didn't think I was any better with the dames than other fellows, and I never liked giving advice. But I wanted to help the poor guy out of his misery. He's always been shy with girls, and I thought I'd give him a pointer or two. All a guy needs is to know how to handle them. Anyway, that's how I felt then and I was much younger then.</p>
<p>"So I waited a few days and at the first opportunity when we were alone I said to Carl: 'Did you ever tell that girl how you feel about it?'</p>
<p>"Well, that seemed to touch off something within him. He hadn't talked much about this business before. But now he was going strong, like a house on fire. You'd expect a sensible guy, even if he was crazy enough to fall in love, would still keep his head and know his rights. But not Carl. To listen to him you'd think she was something out of this world and, believe it or not, he was even blaming himself, I couldn't quite figure out for what. But there he was raving about her and defending her and say­ing it was all his fault, and what a decent kid she was and how nice she'd been to him when he told her and how she had told him he'd find himself some other girl and forget her pretty soon, and other rubbish like that.</p>
<p>"And it was then that we nearly got into a fight," George continued after a short pause. "I hadn't intended to hurt Carl's feelings. That was the last thing in the world I would want to do. If I had known he'd take my remark the way he did, naturally I wouldn't have said anything. But there he was, carrying on like mad and I wanted to get him to see things stright again, so I thought I'd talk tough without really meaning to. 'Man,' I said, 'if you feel that bad about her and no other girl will do, why don't you use a little persuasion on her.'</p>
<p>"I guess he didn't like the way I said that word 'persuasion'. don't know what he thought I meant. I swear I meant no harm. But you should have seen him. He got up and went toward me. He didn't say a thing, just sort of shuffled in my direction, but there was a peculiar look in his eye. Now, I don't scare easily, but there was something about the way he looked that made me back away toward the door. For a moment I was sure he had gone completely out of his mind. The man was mad no doubt about that. Besides, I didn't want to fight Carl. I had nothing against him. So I backed out of the room and left. What's the use: If you are going to start fighting with every madman you'll have your job all cut out for you, for life, too.</p>
<p>"I didn't sleep in the house that night. But the next day we made it up. I saw Carl in the street during the day and he didn't say a word about the near fight we were in the night before. Maybe he forgot about it; more likely he just let on he forgot. I was willing to let it go at that.</p>
<p>"A couple of weeks later there happened what I started out to tell you. I was staying home. I was having a cold or something and didn't go out that night. Around eleven o'clock Carl came in and there was a grin on his face, half way around his head. I was glad to see him happy again. Why should a nice fellow like him suffer for nothing. I'd known all along he'd get over his foolishness by and by. He looked flushed and I thought he must have had a couple of drinks. For a while he didn't say a thing, just started undressing as if he was going to sleep. Then all of a sudden he says, 'I shot down eight ducks, eight out of ten,' and he smiled as if it was a great piece of news. I sat up. For a minute I thought he had gone out of his mind. He just sat there on the bed with one shoe off and smiled like a baby. 'What are you talking about, Carl?' I asked. I don't believe he even heard me. 'Eight ducks out of ten,' he repeated to himself, 'that's not bad, not bad at all!'</p>
<p>"'Where did you shoot the ducks?' I said, 'in Central Park? There is a law against shooting ducks in the park.'</p>
<p>"But Carl didn't say a word.</p>
<p>"'Why didn't you bring some of them home?' I said, 'and we could have some roast duck. I'm sick of meat balls and spaghetti.'</p>
<p>"Then he turned toward me. 'I went down to the shooting gallery on Fourteenth Street,' he said. 'I never shot a gun, any kind of a gun, in my life before. And what do you think happened? With the first load I brought down eight ducks, eight out of ten. That's pretty good I'd say.'</p>
<p>"That's all he said that night. He went to bed and slept quietly. But after that he'd go to some shooting gallery nearly every evening, and then he'd come back and talk about how many wooden ducks he brought down. He didn't seem to care much for the other targets in the shooting galleries. Ducks were the only thing he mostly went after, wooden ducks. He asked me to go with him a number of times. I went once or twice and I was bored. Nothing to it. People are a strange breed of animals and do the queerest things. You'll never see a cow whittling at a stick for hours or a horse aiming at a target. But what some people won't do.</p>
<p>"But as long as it kept Carl happy, I was satisfied. What I was most glad about was that he seemed to have gotten over his crush on that girl. I didn't care to start another argument like the one I almost got into, but after some weeks had passed I asked him cautiously whether he was still seeing her. 'Oh, her,' he said. 'Yes, I see her around the office quite a bit.' And he was that indifferent when he said it as if she had never meant a thing to him. Then after a while he said, 'George, to hell with that girl, or any other for that matter. What a man needs is something worthwhile to do. Take me for instance. Here I had been eating my heart out for months on account of that dame. And all the time it was really nothing. I can see it now. As soon as you learn to do something that you like, something that puts a purpose in your life, it really makes a new man out of you. Sometimes I look at her in the office and I am surprised at myself, that I should have made such a fuss about it and felt the way I did when there are so many real things a man can do.'</p>
<p>"'Why don't you take up some worthwhile hobby?' he said to me.</p>
<p>"I nearly fell over when Carl said that. Imagine me fiddling around with a hobby. But I didn't care to argue with him. As I said, Carl was a swell guy and I liked him. He was just as kind and generous as could be. The only trouble with him was that he hurt easily. First thing you knew you said something and hurt his feelings. So I didn't answer him that time.</p>
<p>"And he just stood there smiling. 'You don't know what you are miss­ing, George,' he said. 'You don't know how much it means to a guy to be able to do something well. I know you think it's silly. But let me tell you, I get a tremendous kick out of it, and much more than just a kick. You pull the trigger. Bang! And there is one of them off the line. It makes you feel good inside to see it. And I can hit eight out of ten. I've done it any number of times. That's pretty good, pretty darn good, even if I say so myself.</p>
<p>"Shortly after that I got a job out of town," George went on, "and I lost track of Carl. Hadn't seen him all these years. Then, a couple of days ago, I was in that shooting gallery talking to the owner, and there he was, over to one side, banging away. I must have stared at him for the owner says: 'You know that fellow? One of my steady customers. Comes nearly every night.'</p>
<p>"Carl didn't notice me or he failed to recognize me. Many years had gone by. So I went up to him. He appeared glad to see me, but not as much as I had expected. He didn't seem to care to talk.</p>
<p>"'Still at it?' I said.</p>
<p>"'Of course,' he said and put away the gun. 'People don't under­stand. I used to talk about it, and they laughed at me.' He looked at me intently as if trying to decide whether he could speak frankly to me as to an old friend without being laughed at. He must have decided he could for he said, 'Many is the time I got nine out of ten, and there were times when I hit a perfect score, but eight out of ten--that's my number, and, I don't mind saying so myself, it's pretty good, not bad, not bad at all.'</p>
<p>"I tried to change the subject. 'Are you married?' I asked him. "'No.'</p>
<p>"'What are you doing with yourself in general?'</p>
<p>"I work--in the same place as when we shared that room.'</p>
<p>"'That's a long time to be stuck in one place,' I said.</p>
<p>"'I don't mind it,' Carl said. 'It really doesn't matter, as long as a guy has something worthwhile to do in his spare time and does it well. What do you do with yourself?' he asked.</p>
<p>"I didn't care to go into details. You know, I seldom do. So I just said, 'Oh, nothing much--the usual I guess.'</p>
<p>"'Still a drifter,' Carl said. 'You didn't find your life's work. Remember? I used to drift too. But that was a long time ago.' He was silent for a moment then he confided. 'There was a time when I thought I'd get myself a gun and go hunting, out in the country. That was a fool­ish notion, I soon discovered that. I am not really a hunter. It's the principle of the thing.'</p>
<p>"The owner of the gallery came over and put another charge into Carl's gun. He picked it up and began aiming at the ducks moving jerkily on their wire. 'I'm sorry to hear about you,' he said, 'that you never settled down to something. Many people don't understand. It's the princi­ple that counts. Eight out of ten! That's not perfect, but it's pretty good, not bad at all, even if I say so myself.'"</p>
<p>George's cigar had gone out some time before. He relit it and remained silent for a while, staring off into space. Then he said: "As you were saying, it's all a question of adjustment. I quite agree with you there."</p>
<p>I hadn't said a word about adjustment. As a matter of fact, hadn't said anything at all.</p>
