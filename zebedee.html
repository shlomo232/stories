    <h1>The Progress of Zebedee Bing</h1>
    <p class=ital>Having surrendered my will to that of the traffic lights, what shall I do now that there is a blackout?		S. Marshak</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Makes His Appearance </p>
<p>My name is Zebedee Bing, he said, but everybody that knows me calls me Zeb, for short kind of .</p>
<p>He and I were sitting on a bench in one of those little parks that dot New York, not parks really, just little irregular areas where a couple of streets have a disagreement and go, their different ways, and the place where they turn away from each other is surrounded with a fence and a few scraggly trees are planted and a couple of benches are put under the trees.</p>
<p>It was a hot, humid summer day, the kind that happens only in New York. The air was dense and heavy, the sun pressed down on head and shoulders unhindered by the thin foliage which hung limp from the sparse branches.</p>
<p>I looked at Zeb who sat a little distance from me on the bench. He was thin, almost gaunt. His brownish hair lay plastered on his head and a wisp of it clung to his forehead. His skin was lightly creased. He might have been in his late twenties, or thirties, or early forties. His clothes were soaking wet.</p>
<p>It's hot, I said. You are dripping wet.</p>
<p>Yeh, he remarked. But it's not the heat. I just committed suicide. You what? I edged away from him.</p>
<p>I committed suicide. Drowned myself.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>In the lagoon, in Central Park, he added.</p>
<p>Why'd you want to do that for?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know. Things sort of got me down, the end of the line, you know what I mean. I figured it's no use carrying on. I wrote a letter to my mom, up in Vermont—that's where I come from. I didn't tell her out­right, just kinda hinted I was mixed up and fed up. Then today, about an hour ago, I went to Central Park, to the lagoon, and rented a boat. Guess one time is as good as another. I rowed out to the middle of the lagoon. It was solid, just covered with boats. You could have walked on the lake there was that many boats. Then I jumped in. I surfaced a couple of times, and I thrashed around a lot; I guess you can't help doing it. But nobody paid much attention. I did hear someone say: Dig that! There is a man drowning! But that was all. Nobody reached out a hand. I went under again and sank to the bottom. A lot of muck there. My lungs were fit to burst, and I struggled. It did seem for a moment I heard somebody wailing way far off. Must have been mom, away up in Vermont. Won't somebody help my Zeb, she seemed to cry. Nobody did. I looked up and saw the bottoms of the boats rocking. Then I must have died. But I was so mad, so mad. And next thing I remember I was walking down Fifth Avenue, my clothes dripping, but nobody paid me no attention.</p>
<p>So you are dead?</p>
<p>I don't know. I guess so. I committed suicide and nobody reached out a hand, so I guess I must be dead.</p>
<p>But here you are still alive.</p>
<p>I suppose so. I don't know. Nobody said nothing.</p>
<p>I lit a cigarette and Zeb stared greedily at it. I handed him the pack and he took one. He felt in his pocket and brought out a gob of wet pulp that must once have been a folder of matches. I lit a match for him.</p>
<p>Where do you live? I mean where do you stay? I asked.</p>
<p>Around the corner, Zeb said. Most of the time. And I sit in this park a lot, and I eat in the cafeteria--he pointed to a coffee shop on the corner.</p>
<p>I got up to go.</p>
<p>See you again, I said.</p>
<p>Sure, he nodded.</p>
<p>What are you going to do now? I asked on second thought. I don't know, he said.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Solves the Air Pollution Problem </p>
<p>The heat wave continued unbroken when I again met Zeb on the same park bench a couple of days later.</p>
<p>Rough, I said.</p>
<p>Worse than that, he responded. It's not just the heat, it's all these fumes. I cough all night.</p>
<p>Maybe you smoke too much, I ventured.</p>
<p>No, it's not that, he said. I don't smoke much. It's the fumes, the air pollution.</p>
<p>I bet you didn't have that up in Vermont? Why don't you go back to Vermont?</p>
<p>Can't, he said curtly. Not after what happened in the Central Park lagoon.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know. I guess I did die in a way, and in a way I didn't. But it seems to me that after that there's no going back to Vermont, or no place.</p>
<p>Yeh, I assented. But I guess there'll soon be some relief from the air pollution. I read in the papers the other day. .</p>
<p>I read it too, Zeb interrupted me. But it seems to me they are tackling it from the wrong angle.</p>
<p>Why, what do you mean, Zeb? Big engineers are working on the problem.</p>
<p>I suppose so, but, I don't know, I still think they are barking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>How would you go about it? I asked.</p>
<p>Well, Zeb said slowly, look at it this way. What makes most fumes? Cars do, naturally.</p>
<p>Go on, it sounds reasonable, I encouraged him.</p>
<p>Less cars less fumes, Zeb went on. But here is the trouble; we got to have a lot of cars.</p>
<p>Why must we? You don't have a car, do you, Zeb?</p>
<p>No, he agreed. I don't need or want a car. But other people do. And just think of what would happen to this country if car production dropped sharply.</p>
<p>What would happen? Why we'd have less air pollution, like you yourself said.</p>
<p>Sure, Zeb agreed, but we'd also have unemployment, a lot of unemploy­ment. The economy of the whole country would break down.</p>
<p>Why Zeb, I wondered. I didn't know you were an economist.</p>
<p>And I am not either. But I read in a paper the other day, I read all about it and, it seems to me . . .</p>
<p>So what would you do to keep up car production and to reduce air pollution? I prompted.</p>
<p>Well, Zeb said, a lot of things would have to be changed. For in­stance, supposing burial customs were changed, I mean the way people bury their dead, and instead of burying them in coffins, there should be a law or something that they should be buried in cars.</p>
<p>That sounds pretty awful to me, I couldn't help exclaiming.</p>
<p>It needn't be, Zeb explained. I don't mean just anybody in any kind of car. There could be class to it. Like, rich people should be buried in Cadillacs, and medium kind of people in Chevys or Fords.</p>
<p>But what about the religious feelings of the dead and their families? I asked.</p>
<p>I was coming to that, Zeb said. Now, Jews for instance could be buried in Volkswagens and Negroes in dump trucks. This would help take care of their feelings. So, you see, about three million people die every year. That means three million cars a year. Detroit could go on working full blast, but the number of cars, and the amount of air pollution would decrease. There would be full employment, and I wouldn't cough so much.</p>
<p>But cars are big, I cried. Think of the land that would be taken up for graves.</p>
<p>I don't know, Zeb mused. Maybe they could be cremated in cars. And then the melted metal could be sent back to Detroit to make more cars for more burials.</p>
<p>And how would you dispose of suicides? I asked.</p>
<p>Zeb looked at me reproachfully. Suicides? he asked. Suicides are only half-dead. They go about among us, like me. But then, maybe they too should be buried. I really don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Supports Law and Order </p>
<p>When next I met Zeb in the park he didn't look too well and every so often he clutched at his side whenever he tried to draw a deep breath.</p>
<p>You should cut down on your smoking, Zeb, I said. Before it is too late. It's getting the best of you.</p>
<p>You are right, Zeb answered. I suppose I should. But this isn't</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>What do you mean, Zeb?</p>
<p>Well, this pain I got, it's not from smoking. I was hit, poked in the ribs, hard.</p>
<p>You? I was genuinely surprised. Don't tell me you were in a fight. You don't look like the brawler type.</p>
<p>And I am not either, and this wasn't what you might call a fight. So what happened?</p>
<p>It was this way--but first let me explain. I am a man of peace. can't stand the very thought of violence. What we need is law and order, all the time, everywhere, that's what I say. But you just look around your­sel , or read the papers, and what do you see? Violence everywhere, murders and muggings and holdups. It's enough to make a man give up in despair. Well, the other day I was thinking about it and I said to myself, Zeb, said, it's not enough to be for law and order and peace and all that. You got to do something about it. But what to do I didn't know. What can a man like me do? So I worried along and for a while I couldn't think of a thing to do. Then I said to myself, darn it, Zeb, I said, If you can't do anything big about it you can at least speak up for law and order, sort of bear witness to it, like the minister back home in Vermont used to say. Tell other people how you feel, and that may set them to thinking, and maybe they feel the same way you do, and first thing you know this sort of thing spreads around and people start being less violent and more law abiding. I don't know, maybe it wasn't such a good idea, but just then I thought it was a pretty good notion.</p>
<p>Sounds OK to me, I encouraged him. And then what happened?</p>
<p>Well, Zeb went on, I saw this cop standing on the corner, and he looked kind of sad, and maybe bored too, just pacing back and forth a couple of steps either way and twirling his stick. I'll talk to him, it flashed through my mind. He needs it most. He's the man whose job it is to main­tain order and enforce the law and see that things are peaceful and quiet. All the time he is on the job he's got to deal with violence and disorder. I'll tell him I am a law abiding citizen and a man of peace. It'll make him feel good. He won't feel so lonely, just by himself among a bunch of beasts.</p>
<p>And what happened next? I asked.</p>
<p>Well, Zeb said, it was kind of funny. He spotted me some distance away and looked sort of suspicious at me as I was coming up. I didn't blame him. In his job, and the way things are, he's got to be suspicious of everybody. So much the better, I thought, when I tell him I'm different and all on his side. So I walked up to him, and said, Officer: He stopped twirling his stick and just stared at me. I want you to know, I said, that I am on your side, all for law and order and against hoodlums and muggers and that sort. Well, he just kept on staring at me. So I went on: You can depend on me, officer. I wouldn't cause anybody any trouble, and you least of all because you have your hands full keeping peace and order. If everybody was like me you'd have the easiest job in town.</p>
<p>And what did he say? I asked.</p>
<p>At first he didn't say anything, just stared at me, and then he clutched his club, as if he were apprehensive--imagine him being apprehen­sive of a peaceful man like me--and just muttered, Beat it bum.</p>
<p>And what did you do? Did you beat it?</p>
<p>I was going to. I always obey cops. But I sort of wanted to per­suade him first that I was different, a real man of peace. Maybe I shouldn't have, I don't know. For just then there arose some commotion around the cor­ner; I don't know what it was, but the cop he gave me a good stiff poke in the ribs with his club. Beat it, goof, he said and ran off to where the trouble was. That was two days ago, but everytime I try to take a deep breath it still hurts like heck.</p>
<p>Maybe you'd better see a doctor, I suggested. You might have a broken rib.</p>
<p>Maybe, Zeb said. But that's not important. What counts is that I tried to do the right thing, and look what came of it. What is a peaceful man to do? I don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Strikes a Blow for Non-Violence </p>
<p>Zeb, I said to him a few days later, I have been thinking about what you told me last time, how you tried to give moral support to an officer enforcing law and order and how badly it ended.</p>
<p>It sure didn't work out the way I had intended, Zeb admitted ruefully.</p>
<p>I think I know where your mistake was, I said. You shouldn't have bothered talking to a policeman. As a general rule, don't try to tackle the Establishment, or any of its representatives. They have vested interests. They are dead to the world. They are a lost cause, even when their cause is just.</p>
<p>I meant well, Zeb said mournfully.</p>
<p>Of course you meant well, Zeb. I don't doubt your intentions. It's your approach that was wrong.</p>
<p>Well, then, what would you suggest that a man of peaceful intentions, who is against violence and all for law and order should do? Zeb wanted to know.</p>
<p>Zeb, my friend, I began in a tone that might have been just a touch too patronizing, the thing to do is to work at grass roots level. Never mind the minions of the law, to hell with City Hall--you know what I mean. Man-to-man, that's my motto. If we can establish confidence between men, why then half the battle is won. Did I say half the battle? The whole battle is more like it. As it is today, people approach each other like wolves; they sniff at each other with hostility; then they start snarling and they bare their teeth. But if we were to try to win our fellow-men's confidence, if we could make them feel that our intentions are peaceful and not aggressive, why from there on everything would go in the right direction.</p>
<p>That's quite a speech you just delivered, Zeb said and I thought I detected a note of irony in it. Maybe your system is the right one, maybe it isn't. I don't know. I tried it and . .</p>
<p>And it didn't work?</p>
<p>I really don't know if it worked or not, Zeb said.</p>
<p>What do you mean if it worked or not, Zeb said.</p>
<p>What do you mean you don't know? Either it did or it didn't. Tell me about it.</p>
<p>Oh, it was simple enough, Zeb began. There I was sitting at a bar and next to me there was this shrimp of a fellow. I mean, he was no youngster, maybe middle aged, but he was kind of small. Altogether a not very impos­ing man. And he had that look about him, well, the look of a nan that was licked. He was sitting quietly over his drink and he somehow caught my at­tention and I began to feel sympathy for him. There is a man, I said to myself, who's had it rough. Looks like the sort that everyone picks on, and he's probably got no defenses at all. I'll cheer him up, I thought. I'll talk to him, and act friendly. Reassure him kind of. He sure looked like he needed reassurance more than anything else.</p>
<p>So I started up a conversation with him, Zeb continued. You know, the weather and how it's getting worse from year to year; and the drinks, how they get shorter and shorter while the price keeps going up; and how mean people are getting to be--violence and more violence all around so that it seems you can't even walk down the street any more without risking being attacked.</p>
<p>Well, this little man listened attentively. It seemed I struck a responsive chord. And then he too began talking and telling me things about his life, and it was just as I suspected: he was a man victimized all around—by his boss, by his landlord, by his wife, by plain ordinary hooligans in the street.</p>
<p>Non-violence, Zeb continued. That's what I told this man. What we need is non-violence. Don't practice violence and don't use it when it is practiced on you. That's the answer to the problem. Look at us, I said to this man. Here we sit talking friendly and peaceful. Do you attack me? No. You don't. Do I attack you? No, I don't. And so all is well between us. Yet, you know it could be otherwise. Here I am much bigger and stronger than you. Why I could lick you with one arm tied behind my back. Do I do it? No, I don't, because I believe in non-violence. But you see for your­self that I could, if I wanted to.</p>
<p>And what happened next? I asked.</p>
<p>It was funny, unexpected, Zeb said. The little guy looked scared, he edged away and then quickly walked out. I'd tried to reassure him and he ran away. Did I do something wrong? Did I say something wrong?</p>
<p>don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Says: All God's Children are Grandchildren </p>
<p>Cheer up, Zeb, I said. The heavens haven't caved in yet. There must be hope somewhere. Things can't be all that bad. There must be something promising.</p>
<p>Like what? Zeb sounded despondent.</p>
<p>Like what? Like children for instance, I took up his challenge. They are our future and they are unspoiled.</p>
<p>Maybe, Zeb sounded unsure. But if they are still unspoiled they sure will be before they stop being children.</p>
<p>Seems to me, Zeb, that you had an unhappy childhood. Tell me about it.</p>
<p>Oh, it was nothing special. I don't know, but I guess it's pretty much the same in every family. Mom nagged Dad a bit, and Dad would get mad and nag her, then they'd both nag me.</p>
<p>And what did you do?</p>
<p>Me? I sulked. And sometimes I smashed things, and I dreamed a lot of running away.</p>
<p>That doesn't sound too bad, I reassure him. Sounds to me like your family was pretty average.</p>
<p>I suppose so. But the main thing is, there is so much conflict between parents and children. They all hate one another so that it ruins all of them, even when they don't know it.</p>
<p>Surely you can't mean that's so in all families all the time, can you Zeb?</p>
<p>I don't know, but science says so. Like the Oedipus complex, for instance.</p>
<p>Zeb, you always surprise me with how much you know, I said. Now how do you understand the Oedipus complex?</p>
<p>Oh, this one is simple, it just means that every boy wants to murder his father and marry his mother; and the same way for girls. I mean they want to murder their mothers and marry their fathers.</p>
<p>Uh uh, I assented. That's what I thought it was. But how can you get around that?</p>
<p>In a way it's simple. All we have to do is change society so that children should live with their grandparents instead of with their parents.</p>
<p>What I really mean is that children, all of them, should first of all be regarded as grandchildren instead of as children.</p>
<p>And how will that fix matters? I asked.</p>
<p>How? Easy. Have you ever heard of anyone wanting to kill his grandfather and marry his grandmother? Of course you didn't. Or have you ever come across the case of a person suffering from a grandfather complex, or anything like that?</p>
<p>No, Zeb, I haven't, I had to admit.</p>
<p>Well, that's what I mean. Children should be grandchildren. The parents should be free to do as they please while they are still young. Then their turn will come when they become grandparents. Let's take a concrete case--you. Did you have much trouble with your parents?</p>
<p>Not more than usual, I admitted. But we did have some rough moments. And I was glad to get away when I grew up.</p>
<p>And did you have grandparents?</p>
<p>I suppose I had four of them, but I only remember two. The other pair died before I got to know them.</p>
<p>And did you ever have any trouble with the two grandparents you did know?</p>
<p>No, I had to admit. They were a bit of a drag, but we never had a fight. Grandpa would beam at me no matter what I did. And grandma made the finest cookies you ever saw--and I got plenty of them. Mostly she baked them for me.</p>
<p>There, Zeb was triumphant. That's what I mean. Imagine what a finer person you'd be if you'd grown up with your grandparents and been a grand­child till you came of age. No complexes, no hate, no grievances, no claims on you. Or consider the following. A teacher in a first or second grade addresses her class: "Children!" Right away they are scared and feel they'll be asked to do something they can't do, and they resent the teacher. But if the teacher were to address the class, "Grandchildren!" I just bet they'd feel at ease and they'd laugh and be happy because grandparents are never rough or demanding.</p>
<p>With amazement I watched Zeb's face glow with triumph as he developed his idea.</p>
<p>I think you got something there, Zeb, I said. But how would you go about it, considering how the family has been the way it is for so many thousands of years?</p>
<p>That is a problem, Zeb pondered. I suppose we got to make a start somewhere. I was thinking about this the other day and it occurred to me that maybe, if instead of insisting that we are all God's children, we were to say, "All God's children are grandchildren," that would start the ball rolling. See what I mean? No more children; only grandchildren.</p>
<p>Maybe it would work and maybe it wouldn't. I don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Remembers a Sermon </p>
<p>It was a mild Sunday afternoon and Zeb was in a mellow mood when I met him.</p>
<p>Things wouldn't be so bad, not so really bad, he mused, if only it wasn't for memory.</p>
<p>I get what you mean, Zeb, I assured him. We all remember too much. Why, take me, for instance. I just know I remember too much, too many bad and disappointing and hurtful things. They come back to plague me though they happened long ago. If only I could forget at least some of them, I'd feel happier.</p>
<p>You are wrong, Zeb said. The way I see it, it's the other way around. We don't remember enough. And we know there's something missing. And it troubles us. Besides, there's a lot of good lessons . . .</p>
<p>There are a lot of good lessons, I corrected him.</p>
<p>Like I said, he agreed, we learn a lot of good lessons, expecially when we are small, and if only we'd remember them, why .</p>
<p>What would happen if we did?</p>
<p>Why, we'd be better and the world would be better and everything would be better. But we always manage somehow to forget at least part--the important part--of what we learned. And I sometimes believe that this is at the root of much of our trouble.</p>
<p>But Zeb, I protested, if a man forgets something, how does he know he has forgotten it in the first place?</p>
<p>I am glad you asked this question, Zeb said, because, you see, it's this way. If a man forgets something altogether, that's that. He won't ever know what it was he forgot. He may be the loser by it, but at least he doesn't know it. But if he remembers part of something, but not the rest, then he knows there is something missing, and it troubles him, and he frets and worries, and tries to recall what it was he forgot and can't, and that sets him off on all sorts of false leads, and . .</p>
<p>I could see Zeb was troubled by something particular which he had forgotten, so I asked him just what was on his mind.</p>
<p>He was obviously glad to talk about it. It was a sermon I heard, and I forgot part of it, he said.</p>
<p>A sermon! I couldn't help exclaiming. Why Zeb, nobody remembers sermons. That shouldn't bother you. I thought you had forgotten something important.</p>
<p>You don't understand, Zeb said condescendingly. This sermon was different.</p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p>Well, first of all the minister. What a man: One look at him and you could tell here was a leader, a man who could point you right. Tall, must have been six feet at least; and conviction, what I mean. One look at his face and you knew you would follow him to the end of the earth and be­lieve whatever he said. It's funny, but I even remember his name to this day.</p>
<p>What was his name? I asked.</p>
<p>His name? His name was Harry Noble Frisby, Zeb said and his eyes glowed with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>How old were you at the time? I asked.</p>
<p>Oh, about eleven, maybe twelve, Zeb said, Why, what's that got to do with it?</p>
<p>Nothing. Nothing at all, I assured him. What was the sermon about?</p>
<p>Oh, nothing about religion or God or things like that. It was about how to live right. You should have seen him; better still, you should have heard him as he stood there before the concregation. WATCH, he said and pounded his fist into his palm. What does this mean? How do you spell WATCH? W-A-T-C-H. The W means watch your words; the A means watch your actions; the T means watch your thoughts. And each statement he punctuated by slamming his right fist into his left palm. You should have seen that congregation go for it.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty sensible, I said. And what does the rest stand for? I mean the C and the H?</p>
<p>There's the trouble, Zeb said crestfallen. Try as I might I can't remember what he said the C and the H stood for. Like I said before, if I had forgotten the whole sermon, it wouldn't matter much. But I remember the occasion as if it happened yesterday--only the meaning of the C and the H escapes me. And sometimes I feel as if I had lost the key to the meaning of everything without the meaning of these two letters.</p>
<p>Cheer up, Zeb, I said. This Reverend Harry Noble Frisby was a good and sensible man. You know the warning in the first three letters; the two missing ones must be along the same line.</p>
<p>Yes, I am sure you are right, Zeb said dolefully. But by not remem­bering I sometimes feel as if I had lost the key to my life. What else must I watch? I ask myself. And I don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Bewails a Loss </p>
<p>When I next saw Zeb he seemed unhappy. I asked him what troubled him, but he was at first reluctant to say what it was. Oh, nothing in particular, he said vaguely.</p>
<p>Come now, Zeb, I chided him. Nobody goes around that glum over nothing in particular.</p>
<p>Well, he admitted. It has to do with that sermon I told you about last time; I mean the part of it that I forgot and can't recollect no matter what.</p>
<p>Not that! I exclaimed. Don't tell me that's been on your mind since I saw you last!</p>
<p>Well, yes and no, in a way. He conceded. I mean it's not the lesson of the sermon itself that bothers me. It's the overall idea.</p>
<p>Overall idea? I was genuinely puzzled. Overall idea of what?</p>
<p>The idea of loss, kind of. It's hard to explain. Like when some­one loses something and never finds it again and can't replace it somehow, and his life is never the same again on account of this loss.</p>
<p>Of course, I understand, I said. When one loses something very impor­tant, well that's the way it is.</p>
<p>No, you don't understand, Zeb said. What's important, anyway? Who is to say what's important and what isn't? Let me tell you something, let me try to explain.</p>
<p>Go ahead, I said, not terribly interested; for it seemed to me that Zeb just got tangled up in a bunch of words that weren't terribly important.</p>
<p>Well, he began, when I came to the city—that was quite a while ago—I had a hard time at first. I mean I was really down and out. Would you believe it, but for a while I used to live on coins I fished out from sub­way tracks and through ventilator gratings over subways? You've seen how it's done? Haven't you?</p>
<p>Sure. Looks easy, I said. I have seen lots of kids, and grown men too, do it. All you need is a piece of string with maybe a piece of wood tied to one end. Smear some glue or tar or something like that on the wood. You look through the grating and when you spot a coin on the bottom, lower the piece of wood and up comes the coin.</p>
<p>Yeh, it's easy enough, Zeb said. And if you specialize, I mean if you know where to look, you can pick up a buck or even more a day. Like near main subway stations where a lot of people go by, and lots of them drop or lose a nickel or a dime or maybe even a quarter through the gratings. Well, that's what I did for a living for a while.</p>
<p>Okay, I said getting a little impatient. So that's what other people lost. You didn't see any of them crying, did you?</p>
<p>No, it's not them I am talking about. It's my loss that bothers me. Your loss? What did you lose?</p>
<p>See, it was this way. One Sunday, it was summer then, I was making rounds and the pickings were not too good. They never were on Sundays because not many people travel and those who do are not in a hurry and they don't lose much. So there I was, standing over one of those subway gratings, and I looked down and nary a coin was there, just some scattered pieces of paper and rubbish like that. I don't know what got into me, but I took a quarter out of my pocket and dropped it down, figuring to fish it out again-- for practice kind of, because I was pretty good at it.</p>
<p>A fool thing to do, I interjected.</p>
<p>That's the way it turned out to be; I would almost say a tragic thing, considering what followed. But at the moment it didn't look specially silly. Anyway, it rolled a bit under some rubbish and I couldn't see it.</p>
<p>I wasn't much worried at first. I got myself a long stick and poked around in the rubbish. But I couldn't find hide nor hair of that quarter. It just vanished like. I stood there over that grating for more than an hour fish­ing for it and couldn't find it.</p>
<p>So what's there to worry about? It was only a coin; and it happened years ago?</p>
<p>You don't understand, Zeb said mournfully. It isn't the coin. It's the loss--the sense of loss I am talking about. It isn't what one lost that matters. It's the sense of loss that one can never get over.</p>
<p>Zeb, my friend, I said, I must admit, this one is too much for me. I don't get what you are driving at.</p>
<p>Consider it this way, Zeb said. Many times when I am totally broke, I say to myself: Zeb, if only you hadn't been such a fool, you'd have a quarter now and could buy something to eat. Other times, when I have money, I think to myself: well now, if you hadn't suffered that loss you'd have that much more. Why, I could have a million dollars and I'd still be poorer than I would have been if I hadn't had that loss. You see? It isn't the size of the loss or when it happened that counts. It's the idea of it. After a loss life can somehow never be the same again. Don't you think so? It seems so to me. But I don't know for sure.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Holds Forth on Pleasure and Pain </p>
<p>It was a gloomy rainy day when I next met Zeb in our favorite hang­out on such days. A day fit for suicide, I said as I shook the water out of my hair.</p>
<p>You shouldn't talk of suicide to me, Zeb remarked.</p>
<p>Nothing personal, I apologized, realizing my mistake; after all Zeb had tried suicide while I was just being rhetorical.</p>
<p>OK, nothing personal, Zeb was conciliatory. But why just this day? If you'll consider the matter statistically, you'll have to conclude that any day is fit for suicide.</p>
<p>Oh, come now, Zeb, I was becoming impatient. You are exaggerating a bit, aren't you? And what has statistics to do with it?</p>
<p>Plenty, he said curtly. Everything can be measured statistically. Like for instance?</p>
<p>Like for instance--whether life is worth living. Let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>OK, shoot, I said.</p>
<p>OK then, Zeb took up my challenge. How many different kinds of pleasure can you name and how many different kinds of pain? For you got to admit that life, everybody's life consists of pursuing the first and avoiding, or trying to avoid the latter.</p>
<p>Well, let's skip the philosophical part of your question, I said. This isn't a day for philosophy. But as to the other part, let's see, there is the pleasure of food and drink, the pleasure of resting when one is tired, the pleasures of love and sex, and, come to think of it, it's pretty hard for me to think of others—oh, yes, the pleasures of accomplishment and the pleasure of triumph, and, well, the pleasure of just feeling good all over.</p>
<p>I would leave out the feeling good all over bit, Zeb said testily. That's not a pleasure, that's a state of mind. But we'll let that go for the moment. Now tell me how many different kinds of pain can you list?</p>
<p>What do you mean? Pain is pain.</p>
<p>No it isn't, Zeb said with emphasis. Not any more than saying pleasure is pleasure. Just think. If you prick your finger with a pin, you suffer pain, don't you?</p>
<p>I do, I had to admit, though it is not insufferable, and I am not punning.</p>
<p>And if you prick the same finger with a pin but one-thirty-secondth of an inch away, what do you feel than?</p>
<p>I feel pain again. I don't get it, Zeb. What are you driving at?</p>
<p>I am driving at this, that the second time you feel a different kind of pain, for if it was the same kind, you couldn't tell the differ­ence between the two and you would't know where the pain was inflicted. See what I mean? Every square millimeter of our bodies is capable of</p>
<p>feeling, of suffering a different kind of pain. That in itself is almost infinite. And'that is only on the outside.</p>
<p>You mean there is more? I couldn't help sounding a bit ironical.</p>
<p>Of course there is more, Zeb said with conviction. Then there are the possibilities of pain not on the exterior surface of our bodies, toothache and headache and stomachache and heartache and all the rest, and everyone is different in quality and taste, or you couldn't tell what is hurting you.</p>
<p>Whoa there, I halted him. I understand when you talk about, the different qualities of pain, because that makes us able to identify the source of the pain. But what do you mean when you talk about the "taste" of pain?</p>
<p>That's exactly what I mean, that different pains taste differently. Take toothache, for instance. It tastes sour. And that goes for all the other kinds--each has its own taste.</p>
<p>Maybe you got something there, I had to admit; anyway as long as it hurts it might as well taste bad too. Or as one might say, pain is not only painful but also unpleasant--a double jeopardy sort of deal. But if one is to take your view of things, life is a pretty rotten deal any way you look at it. How is one to go on? How did you carry on?</p>
<p>How, you ask? A long time ago I had reached the point where I felt it was no use going on, that the dice were badly loaded and it didn't make sense to play the game. And then one day I had an experience, a revelation of sorts you might call it. I recall it as if it happened yesterday. I was feeling way down in the dumps, scraping the bottom. I sat down on a park bench to think things over. It was a mild and beautiful spring day. And suddenly, as I sat in the warm sunshine, I felt--it is hard to describe just what I felt--that nothing mattered, neither pain nor loss nor belief nor disbelief, that this one hour in the spring sun was worth more than any­thing else in life, that it justified living. I felt reconciled and decided to carry on. Many times I've been asking myself, was it a wise decision? Was it a foolish decision? I don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Is Brushed by Fame </p>
<p>People like us, Zeb began as we walked down the street to our favo­rite meeting place, the bench in the little park--and by his tone I could tell that he was in a philosophical mood.</p>
<p>Say no more, I tried to interrupt him. When you say "People like us" that's the whole story, and a sad and sometimes ludicrous story it is.</p>
<p>But Zeb wouldn't be interrupted. People like us, he repeated, we live and we die and we leave not a trace to show that we had existed.</p>
<p>Yeh, I chimed in. Like the poet said, "Dust thou art, to dust returnest." How many manage to gain fame and to be remembered by future generations? I asked, waxing rhetorical.. Maybe one in a million.</p>
<p>I noticed Zeb had a faraway look on his face and I thought I'd cheer him up. Zeb, I said, cheer up. You are a young man yet. You have a fine mind and a good character. You may yet have your chance to gain fame and to be remembered among the immortals. Fame, I continued, is most unpre­dictable. It chooses whom it chooses. Many a man went down in history and is remembered centuries later, yet when you take a good look at him, why he was no better than a bum.</p>
<p>The faraway look on Zeb's face persisted. I believe he hadn't heard a word I said. It never fails. You try to be nice to somebody and make them feel good and they never even notice.</p>
<p>You know, Zeb said, once I got pretty close to fame.</p>
<p>You don't say, I exclaimed, and I was a bit sarcastic. You see, I was getting sore at the way Zeb didn't seem to pay any attention to what I'd been saying. Tell us about it. What did you do? Invent something? I know from what you told me some time ago that you didn't win any wars.</p>
<p>No, I didn't win any wars, nor did I invent anything, mine is a philosophical not a practical mind. But I did get pretty close to fame one time, just the same.</p>
<p>I made no comment.</p>
<p>I was living in a rooming house that time; it was some ten years ago. And I had a very nice landlady, Zeb began the story of his brush with fame.</p>
<p>Having a nice landlady, I couldn't help interjecting, may not make you famous, but it is a unique experience. Now take me, for instance, I never had a nice landlady, nor a nice landlord either.</p>
<p>She was an old lady, Zeb went on unperturbed, and she kind of moth­ered me. You see, I was unemployed at the time and down at the heels in a general sort of way. She worried about me; she even fixed my shirt collars a couple of times. Zeb, she used to say to me, what will become of you.</p>
<p>And I couldn't answer her, naturally; I hadn't the slightest idea what would become of me.</p>
<p>Well, one day she told me that she had a niece whom she didn't see very often, a very beautiful girl, and this niece was running for election.</p>
<p>A beautiful girl? Running for office? I couldn't help exclaiming.</p>
<p>Well, Zeb explained, it wasn't exactly a public office she was aim­ing at. You may remember that about ten years ago the people that make Blitz beer used to run annual beauty contests, by public acclaim kind of. First they had	contests and then the lucky half dozen who made the grade had their pictures in every bar and store where Blitz was sold, and there were ballot boxes in the bars so customers could look at the pic­tures and vote for their favorite--real democratic.</p>
<p>Let me guess, I butted in. And this niece of your landlady got elected Blitz queen.</p>
<p>No, not quite. As a matter of fact, she was still in the prelims. But running for election like this, she naturally associated with many Blitz executives who used to take her out. So my landlady told me that as soon as her niece--Sadie Pryor was the name she used in the contest, and this wasn't her real name--got elected and seeing how many big shots in the beer business she was hanging around with, why she, my landlady that is, would introduce me to her and ask her to try and get me a good job with the Blitz people. I had dreams at that time, me getting to be friends with the Blitz queen, dating her and going all over town with her, and people pointing at us, and guys envying me--real fame.</p>
<p>And then what happened? She turned out to be a snob or something? I could have told you that in advance.</p>
<p>No, it wasn't that, Zeb declared mournfully. She didn't get by the prelims, so my landlady never introduced me to her. But to this day I often dream of her. Sadie Pryor! What a beautiful name.</p>
<p>Chin up, I said seeing that he felt downcast. Fame was almost yours once. It can happen again, and with better luck.</p>
<p>You really think so? Zeb asked. I am not sure. I had my chance. Maybe. I don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Acquires a Pet </p>
<p>I've been thinking about what you told me last time, Zeb, I said to him as soon as we settled down comfortably. You are a lonely man, the lone­liest man I've ever known; who knows, maybe even the loneliest man in town.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know, Zeb drawled. I am no exception. I never regarded myself as an exceptional sort of guy.</p>
<p>And loneliness, I went on, is bad. It is not only bad in itself; it is worse than that. Loneliness, Zeb, I declared pontifically, is habit forming, like drugs, for instance. And you know what drugs do to people who get hooked.</p>
<p>You really think so? Zeb asked and there was doubt in his voice.</p>
<p>Of course it's hard on a person. I know that myself. I told you once how lonesomeness got me one time so bad that I called the police. But look at it another way and it has its compensations too. Not big compensations, to be sure, but there are moments when it is positively pleasurable.</p>
<p>There: I cried triumphantly. Isn't that what I told you? It's habit forming. It grows on you and it grows. At first you suffer from it and sometimes even feel desperate, like you did that time you called the cops. But after a while you get to mind it less and less and then you begin to enjoy it a little. You just admitted it yourself. First thing you know, you're hooked and you got the habit and start saying that it has compensations. Compensations hell. A man needs companionship, that's what he needs. Look at me for instance! I concluded on a note of triumph.</p>
<p>Zeb automatically looked at me in response to my last exclamation but quickly averted his face unimpressed. I could see that an idea of his own was shaping in his head. He wasn't long in telling it.</p>
<p>You say loneliness is like drug addiction? he began somewhat sadly. Maybe. I don't think so. It's more like being blind, I'd say. Blind per­sons are always alone. They tap-tap their way along, but always alone. Sure, sometimes some kindly soul will take their arm and help them across a busy intersection, but just when they begin to cheer up at the human touch, the street is crossed, the guide hurries off feeling like a boy scout and the blind man remains with his cane.</p>
<p>You are taking a wrong view of things, I scolded Zeb. You are too, what should I call it, too pessimistic. There are lots of opportunities to break the loneliness habit. Look at me, for instance! I repeated my pre­vious challenge.</p>
<p>Zeb again looked at me and remained unimpressed. So, was all he said. So this, you got to try, you got to make an effort to break the habit. Why don't you join the Y, for example? I nearly shouted.</p>
<p>The Y? Zeb mused. I am not athletic, he declared with a tone of finality.</p>
<p>Then, then, darn it, get yourself a pet. A pet is great against loneliness, almost as good as having a hobby. Why the people of this country spend billions on pets.</p>
<p>Zeb's face suddenly lit up. A pet you say? he exclaimed. Sure. Sure. I tried it. Got myself a little spaniel once, black and white, a real nice dog. A female.</p>
<p>Well, and wasn't the dog good company? I asked.</p>
<p>Oh, so-so, Zeb was noncommittal. I really don't know. The relation­ship didn't last very long. My spaniel ran off—with a poodle of all things. Have you ever seen anything sillier than a poodle? Lost. I posted signs all over the neighborhood, even offered a reward, but nothing happened. I went to the dog pound. I visited the SPCA. Nothing doing. Lost for good. And all on account of a stupid, frizzled, manicured, silly poodle.</p>
<p>From the way Zeb was hard on the poodle I could see he had formed a real attachment for his dog, so I tried to comfort him.</p>
<p>Oh well, these things happen, I said nonchalantly. Some other lonely soul must have picked her up and taken her home. But why give up so easily? You could have gotten another dog, or a cat maybe.</p>
<p>No cats! Zeb said decisively. They only make things worse the way they sit there and stare right into your soul. But I didn't give up. thought it over and decided that for a person in my position and with my temperament what I needed was a sedate and philosophical creature, nothing frivolous. So after considering the matter a while I got myself a turtle.</p>
<p>And? I prodded him briefly.</p>
<p>And--nothing. Come evenings, he'd crawl into his shell, I'd crawl into mine, and that was that. After a while I couldn't stand it, so I moved out--and left the turtle behind. He didn't blink an eyelid when I left--a reptile, you know. The next tenant must have him. Or maybe he died. I don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Writes A Book </p>
<p>Zeb, I said as soon as we settled down comfortably on our favorite park bench, you have experienced so much in life, you know so much, and you have accumulated so much wisdom; why don't you write a book and share your knowledge with other people? i am sure you could write a fascinating book--it may even turn out to be a best seller. And then you too would gain from it. For after it becomes a best seller you could make a mint of money from paperback rights, and film rights and musical rights, and stage, radio and television rights, and reprints and selections and abridgements, not to mention translation rights. Just think of it! You could share the benefits of your experiences with the people of Ireland and Irian and Iran, of Afghanistan and Albania, and also with the Ainus, not to mention the Wends and the Khmers and the Tadjiks. It could turn out to be like it says in the Bible: For out of Zebedee shall come wisdom, and good counsel out of Bing.</p>
<p>A cloud of melancholy cast a soft shadow on Zeb's face when I finished my speech. Indeed, he said slowly, this idea had occurred to me quite a long time ago.</p>
<p>Then why, Zeb, why didn't you act on it? There is nothing in the world that is better or more useful than writing a book. There is always one more good--not to say great--book still to be written, I said with heat, now really warming to my suggestion.</p>
<p>I did, Zeb responded laconically.</p>
<p>You mean you actually did write a book? I said in bewilderment. What happened to it? Did you get it published? What happened to the man­uscript?</p>
<p>No, I did not get it published, Zeb declared sadly. And as for the manuscript--I carried it around in my jacket pocket for a long time until it disintegrated. I had meant to copy it out fresh, but somehow I never got around to it and I don't remember what happened to it finally.</p>
<p>Zeb! Zeb! I exclaimed. How can you be so impractical!</p>
<p>Impractical? he asked. Maybe I am impractical. I don't know.</p>
<p>Oh, well, tell me about how you wrote your book, I said.</p>
<p>It was very simple, Zeb began. It was just the way you described it yourself. There came a time when all of a sudden I became overwhelmed with the weight of my own life. Not that I had lived so terribly long, or that I had had such unusual experiences. You already know quite a bit about my life and that there was nothing spectacular about it. It was just—how should I describe it--the accumulation of life. I remember addressing myself at that time: "My, my, the things you saw and felt in your lifetime, Zeb. They could fill a book. So why don't you write a book about your life, Zeb?" That's what I said to myself. And the feeling, the urge to write such a book became irresistible. I went about it systematically. First of all I bought a large notebook and neatly numbered all the pages; the even pages I num­bered on the left and the odd numbered pages on the right. And you know something? Before I even put down the first word, that notebook already began to look like a real book. I could just see the finished 'book. The contents of the book were so clear in my mind, that I felt that writing the book would be as simple as copying one that is already written. Do you.get what I mean? I look into my mind and copy what is there.</p>
<p>I was so excited about the whole thing, Zeb went on, and I was so sure of it that I postponed the actual writing for a few days. But not for long. I am not that impractical. Then I sat down to the job. The first sentence was easy. Since it was my autobiography I was writing, I began: "I was born on" and I put down the date, "in" and I put down the name of the town, "in Vermont." It was easy sailing for a paragraph or so. I men­tioned my parents, and that took up a few sentences, then I described the town. I filled almost an entire page, and not being used to writing, I stopped and called it a day.</p>
<p>But the next time I began to run into problems. My life had been full of experiences and feelings, it is true, but there was nothing spec­tacular in it. And just to put down facts, like I went to such-and-such a school, I played basketball, I was good in English but poor in math, didn't make any sense. There was no life in a listing of such everyday unimportant facts.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest books are made up of precisely such so-called everyday unimportant events, I declared rather pompously.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, Zeb said But, you see it was this way . . .</p>
<p>Nonsense, I interrupted him. All you needed were a few technical tricks. Like for instance, when you want to write a love story, let's say, you begin like this: "As I approached the bridge over Mud Creek I saw her bending over the railing, her face suffused with sadness. But even as the tears coursed down her swarthy cheeks a ribald breeze played with the hem of her skirt curling it upward. . ." Something like this. It's all a question of "mixing memory with desire" as a certain famous poet, whose name I disremember just now, said.</p>
<p>No, Zeb shook his head. I came to a dead halt on page two for another reason. I know much. But when I came to examine what I know I discovered that I don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Devises a Just Punishment </p>
<p>This crime wave that's sweeping the country is absolutely intolerable, I declared with indignation. Muggings, robberies, rape, murder! Doesn't it trouble you Zeb? Don't you think something drastic should be done about it?</p>
<p>Oh, I suppose so--I don't know, Zeb replied apathetically.</p>
<p>What do you mean, you suppose so. Don't you see it happening right and left? Doesn't it affect you? Why, a man can't walk down the street in safety in the middle of the day. Do you feel safe?</p>
<p>Well, Zeb drawled in a monotone, as if the subject didn't concern him closely. It's true that in a literal sense I haven't been either mugged or robbed or raped or murdered, not lately anyway. Of course, in another sense we have all been conned and robbed and raped and mugged. But that isn't what you are talking about.</p>
<p>Aw, come on Zeb, I said impatiently. I am talking sense and you day­dream about something in "another sense." There is no "other sense." It's a real problem and we have to face it realistically. What I say is we are pampering criminals too much. Fear and fear alone can stop, or at least sharply reduce crime. If some punk of a mugger knew he'd have to spend a dozen years in jail--and I am talking about a jail with no TV sets in the cells--you betcha he'd think more than twice before he attacked someone.</p>
<p>And if a murderer who maybe killed a father or a mother of children knew that he'd be tried pronto and hanged on a short rope, why I'll give you odds of a thousand to one that the murder rate would drop to near zero.</p>
<p>Maybe, I don't know, was all Zeb said in reply.</p>
<p>Don't you believe in punishment? I cried. Or are you maybe some kind of pacifist cultist?</p>
<p>Oh, I believe in punishment, Zeb, replied with some animation. The subject of crime left him cold, but the idea of punishment seemed to rouse him. I believe in punishment, he repeated and I am no kind of cultist.</p>
<p>OK then, I grudgingly assented. If you don't approve of the kind of punishment I suggested, what have you got to offer? I don't care what it is, as long as it's punishment and it works.</p>
<p>The kind of punishment you suggested, Zeb now warmed to the subject, is primitive and coarse. Maybe it worked in ancient times. But now we are civilized people and something different is called for. Something modern. You couldn't sell capital punishment nowadays even if you offered it at bargain-basement fire-sale prices. Why, if you asked a man while he was being murdered whether he was in favor of capital punishment for his murderer he'd deny it even as his throat was being slit.</p>
<p>What I would do, Zeb said, and a dreamy look came into his eyes, is this. Supposing you catch a murderer, I mean there is no doubt whatever that he had committed a murder. I'd impose the following sentence on him. I'd buy him a brand new car, give him all the money he needs and sentence him to drive one thousand times across the continent and back. He could stop to eat at designated restaurants, and to sleep at designated comfort­able motels along the road. He could drive as fast as he liked, or as slow. In fact, if he felt like it, he wouldn't have to drive at all. He could stop at one of the motels for six months at a time if he wanted to. But he couldn't leave the designated route, nor engage in any occupation, nor make phone calls from the way. And he had to complete his sentence.</p>
<p>Of course, a couple of guards would always follow him to enforce these simple rules. Let's see now, Zeb said and did some mental calculating. One thousand round trips would be about six million miles. Driving on an average of three hundred miles a day, the murderer should complete his sentence in about fifty-five years—if he keeps constantly on the go that is.</p>
<p>You call this punishment for a crime like murder? I gasped. Why an innocent bus driver doesn't have it much better.</p>
<p>No, no, Zeb objected. Don't say that. A bus driver is free. Free! You understand? If he can afford it, he can quit his bus and become a post­man, or go to college and then teach freshman English for fifty years, or operate a computer, or something like that.</p>
<p>Well, maybe, I said reluctantly. Maybe there is some difference, but it isn't much. The way I look at it, your punishment for a murderer is pretty much the way any ordinary innocent Joe lives these days. It might produce a riot but it won't deter crime.</p>
<p>There is some reason to what you say, Zeb admitted. Who can tell? Maybe we are all undergoing the kind of punishment I suggested.</p>
<p>All of us undergoing punishment? For what? I cried.</p>
<p>For what? Zeb echoed my cry. Maybe deep inside we aren't as inno­cent as we'd like to think we are. And we are being punished, the modern way. Who knows? I don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Has a Dream </p>
<p>It was a sombre sort of day. You know what I mean; the sky was overcast in a dull gray kind of way that made you feel that the sun would never come out again, that maybe there was no sun at all above those clouds. It wasn't exactly cool, but then again it wasn't warm either. You just didn't feel the temperature of the air around. And it—the air I mean—was so perfectly still that it just might not have been there. It's kind of hard to explain, I know, but it was just as if a person had no shape at all to separate him from the outside, no dividing line, and there was no telling where one's own self ended and the gray and murky outside began. I felt pretty low; it was a feeling that naturally went with that sort of day. I wasn't sad, but sure enough I wasn't glad either. I might say I didn't have any feelings at all and nothing seemed to matter, everything was at a perfect standstill and could go on like this forever without anyone caring.</p>
<p>But if I felt low, it was nothing compared to what Zeb seemed to feel. When I looked at him I would have been shocked, had I been capable of shock on this particular day. His eyes were dull, his skin had no special color, his face, which seldom looked very expressive, was a total blank. There he was, but it was almost as if he weren't there. No Zeb. Just a bump in space.</p>
<p>The way I felt, indifferent to everything, it cost me an effort, but I made a feeble try. Come on, Zeb, cheer up, I said. The world hasn't come to an end.</p>
<p>Slowly he turned his head toward me and in a flat tone of voice said, No . .  . so that I hardly could tell whether he agreed with me or challenged my assertion.</p>
<p>No, heck no, I said beginning to come out of the lethargy which this day induced in me. It's just a moment like that, we all have it now and then. The moment passes and then we pop right back again. Just you wait and see.</p>
<p>But instead of answering to the point, Zeb announced in the same flat tone as before: I had a dream.</p>
<p>I looked at him without saying a word. I knew he'd tell me about the dream, or he wouldn't have brought the subject up.</p>
<p>I dreamed that I was a soldier, in the army again he said. In my dream it was just like it is today, grey, mild and just oppressive. The camp--if you can call it a camp--was not the usual army camp either. Small clay huts were scattered about in no particular order on the slope of a hill. At the foot of the hill there was a bigger but that was supposed to be a kind of headquarters. I and a few other soldiers moseyed about doing nothing in particular. We didn't seem to wear any special kind of uniform. There was a feeling in the air that this camp was remote, very remote from--from anywhere, and that it didn't matter much what we did, if any­thing, or how we were dressed, and there was also a feeling--at least I had this feeling--that we had been there a very long time and that I was very impatient that something should happen, that we should be discharged, or at least moved to some other place, anything.</p>
<p>You mean you felt you were a lost battalion? Was there a war on?</p>
<p>No, not a lost battalion, Zeb replied. We weren't lost or forgotten, just kind of sentenced, doomed you might say, to stay there indefinitely on that grey and treeless hillside. As to a war, I don't know. I suppose there was a war going on somewhere, but in the dream I didn't know where it was or what about. All I wanted was to get away from there; I wanted out. And then I became aware, somehow, don't ask me how--one doesn't ask ques­tions about a dream—that headquarters had received orders from somewhere that we were to continue camped on that hill for another long but indefi­nite period. I wanted to cry like a baby, but I didn't. Just kept on wandering aimlessly about in the grey day on the dull and grassless soft earth.</p>
<p>Zeb stopped talking. Is that all? I prodded him. Didn't anything happen at all?</p>
<p>That's all, he said. Nothing happened, but the main thing about the dream is that I felt that nothing would ever happen. That someday another order would come from somewhere that we remain there, and after that another and still another.</p>
<p>That's a peculiar dream, I remarked. Do you often have dreams like this one?</p>
<p>Not often, but sometimes, Zeb admitted. I have the same dream, Details differ. The landscape remains much the same, though sometimes it rains. And sometimes in these dreams I can't find my outfit, or forget which outfit I belong to, and then for a while I run around frantically searching for my Company, afraid that if an order came to move I'd be left behind. Though deep inside me I know that no such order would come.</p>
<p>Well, now, that's some dream, I said, not knowing what else to say. But about the war now, for if there is an army there must be a war and bat­tles somewhere, a war is bound to end. All wars end, sometime or other.</p>
<p>I suppose so, Zeb admitted. But who knows? Maybe there is no war, just that camp. I really don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Shapes the Course of History </p>

<p>It's sad, I said to Zeb. It's a sad business, for little people like you and me. I've suspected it all along, but ever since you started tell­ing me your story, I've become confirmed in this conclusion. We pass through life like so many shadows, without even leaving any footprints behind us. We make a bit of noise while we are around, but it's soon dissipated. People like you and me, we are tossed around like so much dust in the wind. We have no more say in what is happening to us than, than . . . And at this point I stopped. I couldn't find anything to compare our helplessness to. Besides, being of basically cheerful temperament, and also open minded and ready to see both sides of each argument, I began to suspect that I was getting carried away with my own rhetoric. Because, it has to be admitted, that we are maybe not so helpless. Don't we have the vote for instance? And in other ways, too, I believe there are things we can do to better our­selves; little things, but they add up just the same.</p>
<p>Zeb smiled quizzically but said nothing.</p>
<p>Come on, Zeb, I prodded him. Don't you agree with me?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know, he said in his usual equivocal way. You are right of course, but there are ways of a different sort where even people like you and me can affect events, even big events.</p>
<p>I see what you mean, I said ready to pop back to my optimistic way of looking at things. You mean exercising our franchise, or forming organi­zations for one purpose-or another.</p>
<p>No, I don't mean that. That sort of thing is kind of useless. have other things in mind.</p>
<p>Like what? I tried to pin him down to something concrete, because much as I liked Zeb I learned that he had this exasperating habit of hiding behind vague generalities.</p>
<p>You won't believe me if I tell you, he said looking at me suspiciously, as if he were wondering whether to share his knowledge with me.</p>
<p>Aw, come on Zeb, why shouldn't I believe you? I trust you more than I trust myself.</p>
<p>He seemed reassured. Only recently I saved President Nixon's life, he declared.</p>
<p>You did what? I cried, thinking I hadn't heard him right.</p>
<p>I saved President Nixon's life, he repeated. See, I told you you wouldn't believe me.</p>
<p>His announcement staggered me and I fumbled for words. It's not that, I stammered, it's not that I don't believe you, it's just . . . Say, Zeb, how come there was nothing about it in the papers?</p>
<p>It's natural. The papers didn't know a thing about it, and never will. Only two people knew about it, the President and I, and he won't talk.</p>
<p>Well . . . I groped for words. Of course, if you say so, I don't doubt it. But how did you do it? And who threatened the President, anyway?</p>
<p>Don't you know that the President has many enemies? Zeb asked.</p>
<p>Sure, sure I know the President has many enemies, but how did you know of the plot, if there was a plot?</p>
<p>There was a plot to assassinate the President, take my word for it, Zeb declared with finality. I wrote him a letter. "Dear Dick," I wrote. "There is a plot afoot against your life. I suggest, no, I urge you to go away from Washington for a while, until it blows over. Please take my advice, take a trip somewhere, preferably out of the country. You could, for instance, go and inspect the fleet in the Mediterranean, or visit the Pope, or see Ireland. They say it is a very pretty country. You can always find a good excuse for such a trip and, anyway, you are President and nobody will contradict you. Best wishes, Zeb." Well, since you lay so much store by what the papers say, you must admit that you did read in the papers that Nixon did just as I advised and took the trip to exactly the places I recommended, didn't you?</p>
<p>Yes, Zeb, I admitted with a feeling of awe. I sure did read in the papers about Nixon's trip. But there was no mention of you as the author of the plan.</p>
<p>Did you expect President Nixon to hold a press conference and tell them about me? Zeb asked, and there was just a touch of gentle irony in his voice about my political naivete.</p>
<p>No, I conceded. Come to think of it, it would be most unlikely for him to do so. `But the plotters, what about them?</p>
<p>What about them? Zeb echoed my question. Their plot was foiled and they scattered I suppose.</p>
<p>And did Nixon ever express his gratitude to you for saving his life? No, Zeb said. I didn't expect him to. And I am sure my letter of warning to him is not preserved in the presidential files. This kind of communication never is preserved.</p>
<p>Then, then, I stammered again, how do you know Zeb? How do you know that it was your advice that saved the President's life? I believe you, of course, but how do you know?</p>
<p>Belief, that's what matters, Zeb said. I believe. Now you too believe. Events support this belief. But so far as knowing is concerned-- I don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Shapes the Course of History (II) </p>
<p>Zeb, I said as soon as we met the following day, I've been thinking about what you told me last time, how you saved President Nixon's life. I can't get it out of my mind. One minute I believe it implicitly, and the next I have doubts. What's lacking is proof, and I haven't the faintest notion how one could prove or disprove it. Is this the only time you inter­vened in the shaping of history? This is important, because if it happened more than this one time, then maybe that could serve as proof.</p>
<p>Zeb smiled one of his gentle remote smiles that always gave me the creeps--it made me feel like he was not there, like he was seeing things and hearing things that I couldn't hear or see.</p>
<p>There were other times, he finally said.</p>
<p>And did your interventions always work out, like they did with Nixon?</p>
<p>Sometimes they did, and other times they didn't, he said. There was the case of Kennedy, President Kennedy, not his brother. He wasn't Presi­dent then. He was just a candidate. You may recall that during the cam­paign the papers reported that John Kennedy was suffering from an acute case of laryngitis. But of course, I knew that it was something much more serious than laryngitis. I called Hyannisport at once. As luck would have it, neither John nor Jacqueline was there. I left a message. I think it was one of the butlers who took the message, a dull sort of person. I urged that John should see a top throat specialist at once. "Who should I say is the message from?" the butler wanted to know. "Just tell them it's from Zeb," I said, "they'll know." But he was persistent, the butler I mean. "Yes, Mr. Zeb," he said, "and what is the first name please?" I had quite a time explaining to him, he was so dull. "Zeb isn't my last name," I practically had to spell things out for him. "My last name is.Bing, and my first name is Zebedee--Zeb for short. But all you have to tell them is that Zeb called. They'll know." He got the point finally and, "Yes, Mr. Bing," he said. "I'll give them your message without delay."</p>
<p>The butler must have been as good as his word. The papers made no further mention of Jack's laryngitis, as they called it, and Kennedy won, by a nose.</p>
<p>Zeb's face suddenly lit up with a smile. Oh yes, he began enthusi­astically, there was also that time when we had the trouble with Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. You have no idea how close we came to a real catastrophe. There was no time to lose so I phoned Khrushchev direct. But it took me some time to get through to him in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>I am not surprised, I interjected, considering the kind of dictator­ship those Russians have.</p>
<p>No, it wasn't that, Zeb corrected me. The delay was mostly because I asked to have the charges reversed and they had a bit of trouble figuring out how much the call would cost in rubles. You know, I suppose, that they still use the ancient counting frames. I was hanging on that phone, all on fire with impatience, because every minute counted. Finally they connected me. I announced myself and Khrushchev began in the usual wordy Russian manner: Zdraystvuytie. Kak pozhivayetie tovarishch Zieb? Those Russians do have a funny way of talking. I cut him short. "Nikita," I said, "this is urgent. Kennedy is scared stiff of the missiles you put up in Cuba. You can't blame him--Castro isn't the sort of person to trust with gadgets like that. You are a father, Nikita. When your children were small, did you let them play with. matches? Well, this Castro, he is like a baby. Please radio your missile carrying ships to reverse course at once." It seems Khrushchev got the point. "Aw Kay," was all he said and hung up. And some two hours later the papers came out with pictures of these Russian ships, their decks loaded with missiles like so many telephone poles, turning around. They made beautiful curved wakes. It made me smile.</p>
<p>Wonders will never cease, Zeb, I said. But will your influence work always?</p>
<p>I've been wondering too, Zeb admitted. I don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Shapes the Course of History (III)</p>
<p>But the best one I recall was the time I had with LBJ, trying to convince him not to run for another term in 1968. He was not a bad guy. A little ambitious perhaps, but then who isn't. Otherwise he was just as friendly and generous a man as you could hope to know. Loyal, too. I guess maybe it was that western—or maybe southern—streak in him. Dependable—that was LBJ all over. But stubborn. I never in my life saw another man as stubborn as he. Once he made a decision, or started out on something, there was no budging him. He could know inside himself that he was wrong, still, he would never change course. His closest friends couldn't persuade him. He lost a lot of friends that way, too, because he couldn't stand being contradicted. A mere hint of a suggestion that he was in the wrong, and he'd get sore.</p>
<p>And there he was, LBJ I mean, stuck with that Vietnam deal. He knew he had made a bad mistake but wouldn't hear of backtracking. And all this time the country was going to the dogs on account of this war. It was becoming clear to everyone that another four years of LBJ and this country, all fifty United States, would be through, for good. But nobody dared sug­gest to him to withdraw from the race. He broke off with friends for much less than that. And in a way you couldn't blame him either. Being Presi­dent of the U.S. of America--that ain't hay. A man like Washington had the guts to say, "I've had enough. Now get somebody else." But that sort of man doesn't come in crowds.</p>
<p>I realized it was time for me to act. So I called the White House and I gave LBJ a piece of my mind.</p>
<p>"Zeb, you too!" LBJ said, and I could tell his feelings were hurt. But I wouldn't be put off that easy. It was too important to convince him that simply out of love for Texas and the other forty-nine he had to make this great sacrifice. So I explained things to him, in detail, practically spelled them out for him.</p>
<p>"Zeb," LBJ said, and by the tone of his voice I could tell that he wasn't sore any more, "I hope I won't hurt your feelings when I tell you that you don't know your ---- from your elbow. I have it straight from my top generals that we got them Hong Congs, or whatever you call them, on the run. One more push, and they'll be all washed up. All we need is another half million or so men and a bit of additional equipment, and the game will be over. Take it from me, Zeb, from here on it's a cinch."</p>
<p>And that was that. I called again and again, and always the same story. You couldn't budge the man, no more than you could budge the Empire State Building. For a moment I was desperate—really didn't know what more to do; and then it came to me like a flash of lightning, cherchez la femme.</p>
<p>Why Zeb, I exclaimed in amazement. I didn't know you knew French.</p>
<p>Only a little, Zeb said modestly. Oui Oui, De Gaulle, things like that.</p>
<p>So I called Ladybird. And that did it. She put the heat on LBJ. It wasn't till more than a year later that the story leaked out to the press that it was Ladybird who persuaded him not to run again. LBJ admitted it himself.</p>
<p>I looked at Zeb with awe. There was no disbelieving him. For one thing, Zeb is not the sort of a man to tell lies, and there was all that evidence, reported in the papers, to uphold him. I finally regained my composure. It is amazing, I said. Everything you told me is positively amazing. Are there many who have this ability to pass through barrier walls like so many ghosts to reach the very seats of power and to direct the destiny of men and nations?</p>
<p>Many? Zeb wondered, as if the question had never occurred to him before. No, not many. Some three dozen or so, I'd say. It's not a ques­tion of numbers, he added somewhat irritably.</p>
<p>Then who are they? How do they get to be that way? How can one recognize them? Are they in touch with each other? Do they ever meet? The questions rushed out in a torrent, because the things Zeb told me pre­sented so many riddles.</p>
<p>Zeb's voice was calm as he answered me. They get to be that way in the course of time, when they reach a point in their lives when they realize that this is the only way left to them. They do not know each other because they are scattered everywhere, though when two of them happen to meet, they recognize one another. They never meet on purpose. Each of them is simply aware that there are others like him, without knowing their names or where they are.</p>
<p>And in the end? I cried. What happens to them?</p>
<p>In the end? Zeb wondered. Some continue to use this power for what they think is the good of all and to believe in it till their dying day. Others lose faith.</p>
<p>And then?</p>
<p>Then they too die.</p>
<p>And you, Zeb, do you retain faith in this power of yours? Also for the future?</p>
<p>Zeb's voice was a whisper as he answered, I don't know.</p>

<p class=subtitle>Zeb Takes His Last Walk </p>
<p>It was Sunday, a beautiful Indian Summer day, mild and melancholy, a day for gentle sadness and forgiveness and reconciliation, a day for knowing that it's the end, all over, but with no self-pity and no recrimination. Me, I'm no sentimentalist, but this kind of day--it got me too. I was going to meet Zeb, as I always did on Sundays, and I aimed to tell him something good, something comforting, something that would make him feel glad, even if only for a moment, because Zeb, he is a very sad man.</p>
<p>You get to know him and his life story and his ideas and you feel like call­ing it quits. But what to say to him--that I didn't know. I just hoped the right words would come of themselves.</p>
<p>But as I approached him and looked at his face I was shocked. All life seemed to have drained out of it. His eyes were glassy and stared into space. His lips were moving and he muttered something but I couldn't make out any words.</p>
<p>Zeb: I cried. What's the matter? What happened?</p>
<p>He must have heard me for he turned his head toward me. But he didn't seem to recognize me. An expression of annoyance briefly flitted across his face, as if I had interrupted him somehow.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to do. I sat down near him and started talking to him. Look Zeb, I said, I'm your friend. Tell me what happened; you'll feel better. He only continued muttering indistinctly. I lit a cigarette and offered him one. He ignored it. Then he rose and spread his hands in a gesture of despairing confusion. I now caught a few of his words. The words were: Considering as how . . . then his muttering again became indistinct.</p>
<p>He started walking down the street, northward, toward Central Park, at a regular doomed pace, oblivious of everything about him. I walked alongside him. There was no mistaking where he was going or what he intended to do. Wait, Zeb I cried. Wait! Stop a minute! Let's talk about it. I want to tell you something. But he didn't seem to hear me. I fell a few steps behind him. We crossed one street after another. He didn't stop for traffic signals but walked on steadily as if he had been wound up. Fortunately, because it was Sunday, there was little traffic. Once or twice as he crossed a street he seemed to be on a collision course with a car, and I stopped in terror and yelled Wait! But he did not seem to hear or see anything and maintained his pace and at the last moment the cars missed him. Once he stopped momentarily in the middle of a block, spread his arms wide and I heard him say: I don't know! Then he resumed his march.</p>
<p>On and on we walked, Zeb in front, I a couple of paces behind, past 34th Street, past 42nd Street, past 57th Street. He entered the Central Park zoo and I after him. Here the crowds were quite dense with Sunday visitors but Zeb did not abate his pace nor turn to the right or left. The crowds seemed to part before him without noticing him, nor he them. A sense of dread came over me: He is not real, I thought. He is no longer real. He could walk through a solid wall.</p>
<p>He turned left and seemed to float up the steps near the bear cages, then he turned right and onto the Mall. Now and then he would stop and seemed to engage in argument with himself, but the only words I could dis­cern were the ones I heard before: Considering as how . . . and, I don't know.</p>
<p>He crossed 72nd Street amid a swirl of Sunday cyclists and with the same even step he descended to the lake. He did not even halt at the shore but walked right into the water. When the water was up to his shoulders he did make a few strokes, as if to swim out to a point of greater depth. Then he sank once and did not rise again, sending a ripple in all directions.</p>
<p>I stood on the shore like one entranced. </p>
<p>Like a stone, I thought. Just like a stone.</p>
<p>Then a deep yet peaceful sorrow overwhelmed me. Tears came to my eyes. I looked at the spot where Zeb sank and I intoned:</p>
<p>Zeb, you are now going to a place where there are neither heights nor depths nor level places. When you get there, speak for us, Zeb, intercede for us.</p>
