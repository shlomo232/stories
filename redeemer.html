    <h1>My Redeemer Cometh . . .</h1>
<p>The arguments went on a long time, acrimonious arguments that almost invariably ended with old Mrs. Fein crying softly, and her son Herbert pacing back and forth before her in silent wrath. And as he stopped to say good-by, she would cringe in her chair like a child expecting to be punished. "I don't want anything from you," she would plead. "I don't want a thing. I can take care of myself. Just don't make me do that."</p>
<p>"But, mother," Herb would try to keep his voice calm and controlled, "but mother, be reasonable, please; you aren't a baby after all . . Don't you understand? It's for your own good. We are much concerned about you."</p>
<p>Mrs. Fein would then hunch her shoulders to control their twitching and pat her eyes with her handkerchief to soak up the tears. "I know, I know. But you needn't worry about me. I can take care of myself. I can take care of myself perfectly."</p>
<p>And feeling that the danger had passed for the moment, she would suppress her sobs and regain her composure somewhat. Frustrated, desperate, helpless, Herb would dutifully touch his lips to his mother's wrinkled old forehead and bid her good-by, but not before having his final say, like the last rumble of a passing thunderstorm that hints of an early return, "Mother, you are being unreasonable. You just can't go on living like this all alone at your age. Something must be done about it before any­thing happens to you. All right, all right, we'll talk about it next time, more calmly. Good-by, Mom."</p>
<p>"Yes, Herbie; yes, son; next time, of course, of course," she would smile approvingly like a child dismissed from school for whom the misery of next day is infinitely remote. "Good-by, and come to see me again soon, soon, and bring the family next time."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the beginning there was not much rancor. The idea first came up when Mrs. Fein was in her middle seventies and her husband had died. Her­bert then suggested with apparent warmth that she come to live with him. He argued with conviction and what he believed was sincerity. But his face flushed with guilty shame when he felt decidedly relieved that she rejected his suggestion. The offer was repeated a few times more, but now it was little more than a formality, both mother and son sharing the secret knowledge that the offer was not genuine and that it would be a severe breach of etiquette between them were she to take it literally. Since Mrs. Fein really did not want to go to live with her son and daughter-in-law, these polite exchanges were soon dropped.</p>
<p>But about one year later Mrs. Fein fell ill and needed an operation. When she returned from the hospital, Herbert made no mention of her coming to live with him. A home-maker was engaged to help her during her conva­lescence. As soon as she fully recovered, Mrs. Fein discharged the home­maker, and it was then that Herbert first suggested that, in view of her age and condition, it would be a sensible idea that she should seek admis­sion to a Home for the Aged.</p>
<p>"Go on, I'm not that old," she tried to make light of the suggestion.</p>
<p>"Mother, you are wonderful," Herb complimented her. "I always knew that. Of course you're not old. There are times when I feel older than you. You know, a person feels as old as he . . ."</p>
<p>But the look of suspicion on his mother's face cut short his banal­ities, and he blushed at the betrayal he was plotting.</p>
<p>She had caught him in a lie and was moved to pity and forgiveness,</p>
<p>as often she had been when he was a boy and she caught him in some mischief. "Don't kid me," she said, and there was the suggestion of a wink in her eye as she tried to make a joke of the matter and to assert her maternal authority. "I know I am old." (Mama knows best.) "But let's not talk about it now." (Attend to your own affairs and be sure to do your home­work.) "Let me make a cup of coffee." (Mother, protector and source of nourishment, is not to be sent away to a Home for the Aged.)</p>
<p>Thus the first conversation on the subject ended with Herb's defeat, and for months the matter was not brought up again. Mrs. Fein continued as before. She overcame the shock of her husband's death, and the loneli­ness turned out to be not unbearable. She talked to herself much, and to the invisible presence of her husband, and found it comforting. Life seemingly could go on like this indefinitely and peacefully, making her bed in the morning, doing the bit of shopping for her modest needs, cook­ing a simple meal for herself, washing the couple of dishes, glancing through a paper, visiting with an old neighbor, occasionally entertaining a friend and listening to gossip, and, of course, the daily telephone conversation with her son and her daughter-in-law and her two grandchildren. Good-by, grandma, call again.</p>
<p>	In talk with neighbors, the Home for the Aged came up now and then, but always concerning others. Not she. No. Not she. It was really a wonderful place for those who needed it, and it should be helped, and it did provide a wonderful service for the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She had visited it once years before together with her late husband, on some social occasion, a fund raising meeting or something like that in the Home auditorium. So terribly long ago. The Director had showed them around the place. "Two to a room," he had pointed out proudly, "and every two rooms have a joint bathroom." They looked into one of the rooms. Two beds neatly hugged the walls, a window faced on a lawn, two dressers on each side of the window were cluttered with bric-a-brac and many photo­graphs of children and grandchildren, all young and vital and always being graduated from something. Then they were shown down the length of the hall to a wide lounge furnished with sofas and soft chairs and a television set. They were taken to the dining room where the tables stood in military order.</p>
<p>"May we see the second floor?" someone in the party had asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, the second floor," the director had sounded embarrassed, "why, of course, but there is really nothing special to see there; the arrange­ment is pretty much the same as on the ground floor. You see," he smiled, self-consciously, "we do everything we can to make the old folks happy, but the second floor of course, you understand, we mostly assign the older ones there, I mean the ones who are not ambulatory, or who are sick or senile maybe. And we really don't have much time now . . ."</p>
<p>But some in the party insisted, and they were taken to the second floor.</p>
<p>As they turned on the landing they were assailed by a prolonged, thin scream and they looked at each other and at the Director in alarm. He tried to reassure them. It was not someone in pain. "No one is being tortured," hd smiled wryly. Just an old man who for some reason expressed himself thus.</p>
<p>But now their equanimity and sense of pride in the Home had been shaken. They huddled in a bunch at the top of the stairs, vaguely afraid to venture down the length of the corridor. An ancient woman was feeling her way along the wall with the help of a cane; another stood in the door­way to her room, her face blank, her mouth wide open, and stared at them with incomprehension. In the distance an attendant was pushing an old man in a wheel chair and his lifeless fingers dangled over the side of the chair like dry and twisted sticks. And over all hung the piercing scream of the unseen old man, terrifying, creating its own nightmare, that was ignored by the other inmates. An old woman stood near the hall telephone holding the receiver to her ear, and in a loud and querulous voice demanded: "I want to talk to my daughter, Syl; I want to talk to Syl; hello, I want to talk to. . . ." Yet somehow it seemed certain that she had not dialed any number.</p>
<p>Quickly the Director led them down the length of the hall and herded them into the unusually spacious elevator. They too were anxious to get back as fast as possible to the ground floor, to be among the living again. But the doors of the elevator remained open for what seemed an eternity, until at last they eerily glided toward each other, slowly, as if closing upon them forever, and finally they touched with a click of finality, like the closing of the lid of a coffin, and the elevator began smoothly groping its way down, moving in time, without a destination toward eternity.</p>
<p>"The elevator is specially adjusted," the Director explained. "Old people are afraid, and many of those on the second floor move very slowly and must have lots of time to get in and out of the elevator."</p>
<p>Mrs. Fein later recalled: It had felt like a reprieve to be on the ground floor again; it was school letting out; it was the doctor smiling and saying: You're all right, everything is in order, you can go home and just take it easy. It was forgiveness. It was a gift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That was long ago. And now the months passed and Mrs. Fein had recurring minor ailments, not serious ones, to be sure, but grave enough to confine her to the house for days at a time when neighbors dropped in to help her, and Herb visited more frequently, more anxious than before, more irritable. And the subject was broached again. But now in a differ­ent tone, for now it was: "Mother, you must. . . . It is dangerous to go on as you do."</p>
<p>And indeed there was no denying any longer that it was not sensible to continue as before, nor even that it was dangerous, for anything could happen, and who would hear the whimper of an old woman in the night? Therefore, the attack was now mounted ever more frequently from a differ­ent angle by the son, the strategist, who sensed his advantage. And thus it was no longer, "It is best for you," or even, "You must," but, "You have no right to do this to us, mother," against which assault old Mrs. Fein had no defenses and could only resist with tears, and arguments which did not convince even herself, for she pleaded, "Don't worry about me," and, "I want nothing from you," and at the same time knew that the staff of authority had passed from her hands into her son's, and that when he was a child and sick and pleaded not to be given medicine, not to be taken to the doctor, or not to be taken to nursery school, she had disregarded his pleas, arid she had done all these things to him, and now the wheel had come around full circle, and it was his turn to do them to her.</p>
<p>Therefore she knew that there was no hope, that in the end she would have to submit, that unless sudden death intervened, a release which she felt would not be forthcoming, it was merely a matter of time, and of lit­tle time at that-for the son's urgency was growing daily, and, indeed, how could she do that to him?</p>
<p>And so, "All right," she said one day, "I'll go. You can start making arrangements and I will sign the application when you bring it."</p>
<p>Yet when the son, good, loyal Herbie, showed himself forearmed and already had all the necessary papers with him for her to sign, the sense of hopelessness and betrayal overcame her and she wept copiously and silently, for now she knew that the end had come indeed, that she was no longer free, that even her consent was now a mere formality which she was expected to give graciously, lady that she was, and that withholding it would not in any way change the course of events. For thus people con­demned to death are led to execution, and if they are brave, they walk of their own accord to the gallows, but guards go at their side anyway, in case they refuse to walk of their own free will, and so, what did it really matter, and, might as well be gracious about it, and with trembling hand she signed, in triplicate, and handed the papers to the son, who took them all too eagerly, seized them almost, and put them in his vest pocket quickly-and smiled. . . .</p>
<p>"Mother, I forgot to mention it, but you are coming with me to the house, for dinner, you are expected, the kids are expecting you, and Jean too." But in his immense relief that responsibility was now being lifted from his shoulders, that Mother would be taken care of and looked after by others-like handing a patient over to a hospital, let the doctor look after him, the doctor knows how, and, relieved, one can oneself retire to the waiting room to await the verdict and meanwhile think all kinds of thoughts and even read a paper or do a crossword puzzle or make a business call from the pay station in the lobby-in his great relief Herb had become confused and forgot one moment what he had said the moment before and picked up the receiver and called his home and, "Hello. I'm bringing Mother over for dinner. Yes. What? Oh! No, I am bringing her. Out? That's out of the question. Well, do what you can. Yes, I must. Good-by.</p>
<p>While old Mrs. Fein slowly shook her head and understood and, "Herbie, some other time, please; I am tired," she whispered. "I see Jean isn't prepared." And Herbie, flustered, dared contradict the obvi­ous, and offered alibis: "Kids, scatterbrains, forgot all about it and made a date with some friends. It's all right. They'll cancel it."</p>
<p>And so she shook her head and said no more, for this was already part of the new life, and there was no turning back, and pretenses could no longer be scrutinized--they had to be accepted.</p>
<p>And she went.</p>

<p class=subtitle>II</p>
<p>When moving day came it was a day of snow and wind, a day chill as death, a day known and expected, yet, when it came, it was a dreaded sur­prise. Mrs. Fein had prepared for it, indeed she had. She had been packing and repacking for days. What should she keep? What discard? And this she had thrown out, and that. And each was a wrench and a burial. What a load of history one accumulates in the course of a lifetime: Ob­jects and more objects. A piece of paper, and a letter, and a scrap of cloth, and an old garment and many, many other things. And she said to herself: This is the final moving and things of this world have to be discarded-so she discarded and set aside and eliminated and condemned. Until, at last, there were only two suitcases and a handbag full of essen­tials—and a secret hope of resurrection in her heart, for this, after all, could not be the final end, now could it?</p>
<p>And then Herb came, cheerful, flushed, rubbing his hands. "Mom, it sure is cold, what I mean cold. Must be ten below. You ready? Wow, what a day:" She understood, and smiled, and said, "Yes, I'm ready. It certainly is a cold day; haven't seen one like it in a long time."</p>
<p>He helped her with her coat then took the two suitcases and went out to the car, while she gave the place a final check to see that no light was left turned on, that the closets were indeed empty, that nothing essen­tial had been left behind, and when Herb came in again and picked up the handbag, she was ready to follow him to the door, and as they walked out she turned the key in the lock and handed it to him.</p>
<p>He hesitated a second, then took it and slipped it into his pocket.</p>
<p>The car turned into the main thoroughfare on the way to the Home and Herb kept up a constant bubbling of small talk about his children and the weather and how he had nearly skidded into a tree the previous day, now and then interjecting a little item of information that concerned Mrs. Fein, and the Home, and the arrangements he had made. He had been to the Home office a day or two before, he said, and they had shown him the room she was assigned, a corner room, he hastened to point out, as if this was very important. And she would share it with a very fine partner, a woman not really old, who didn't have to live in the Home at all--she had chosen to do so for convenience, because she preferred to have company, otherwise there was no need for her to live in the Home at all, he repeated, as she was healthy and active.</p>
<p>He saw the question in his mother's eyes and tried to avoid it so he stepped on the brake unnecessarily and the car skidded on the hard snow until he maneuvered it to a halt at the traffic light and cursed under his breath, and muttered something about things of this world, such as snow tires that are guaranteed to grip but skid instead, and only then did he remark in a casual tone: "The room is on the second floor, yes, a corner room though, and therefore quiet; no traffic in the hall before it, really comfortable."</p>
<p>What he did not tell her was how he had haggled and bargained with the admissions committee pleading for a room on the ground floor, and was turned down because there were other applicants, wealthier ones, whose children undertook to contribute regularly and substantially to the Home in addition to the flat sum paid at the time of admission, whereas he could undertake no such obligation, until the committee members flatly told him to decide quickly whether the arrangement on the second floor was accept­able to him, for there were other deserving applicants waiting for that room too, and it was indeed a great favor they were extending to him and to his mother only because she had been well and favorably known in the community for many years, and because his father before that had been a respected member of the community, for otherwise, God help us, there are so many deserving sick old people, and it was such a struggle to keep up the Home, and some of the other applicants, why, it was positively heart­rending the Mate they were in.</p>
<p>So without consulting his mother and without further discussion he had said, Yes, the arrangement was agreeable, and he was properly appreci­ative and all that. But he did not inform his mother, and only told her about it now as his car crunched through the dry snow and labored its rutted way to the outskirts of the city where the houses were small and surrounded by lawns, now under a thick layer of snow, and in the distance they could already see the Home, a stately two-story red brick building floating on a rise in the midst of an expanse of snow broken by rows of bare trees now swaying dark branches in the dismal grey of the icy late afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One other thing was on old Mrs. Fein's mind: Who had been before her in the room she was about to occupy? What had happened to her prede­cessor? How old had she been? Of what had she died?</p>
<p>But this she could only speculate about, and meanwhile they drew up to the Home and she noted with surprise that Herb was not driving up to the front entrance but carefully maneuvered the car through the deep ruts in the snow to the rear. So that when he stopped before the delivery entrance she remained in her seat wondering why he had done so, until he announced cheerily: "Well, here we are, Mother. Come. Let's go inside. It's miserably cold."</p>
<p>She gripped her handbag and remained standing at the door as Herb opened the trunk and took out the two suitcases and then she followed him inside and an attendant led them to a large room off the corridor. "Mrs. Brown will be here soon," the attendant said and left.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Brown, that's the manager," Herb told his mother. "A wonderful woman. You'll love her."</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Fein sat down on the edge of a chair. With pretended cheer­iness Herb paced back and forth, occasionally rubbing his chilled hands.</p>
<p>There were three chairs along one wall. Several hampers stood along the opposite wall, and a desk and a chair occupied one corner. A cluster of unshielded lamps shed a harsh light. They waited, Mrs. Fein with trep­idation, Herb impatiently. The winter evening set in quickly and the glaring yellow light become more depressing by the moment, yet the door remained shut, so that for an instant Mrs. Fein was about to say, Come, Herb, let us go back; Mrs. Brown can't receive us today—and just as quickly realized where she was and that there was no going back, that all that remained for her to do was to wait.</p>
<p>And Herb, too, found the waiting oppressive and began to tell some­thing intended to break the gloom, something about what one of his children had said or done, and he did not really care what he was saying, or whether his mother was listening, and then Mrs. Brown entered.</p>
<p>She looked flustered and harassed, for it was late afternoon, and dinner had to be served soon, and something had gone amiss in the kitchen, yet here were these two to be attended to, so that when Herb said, "Mrs. Brown, this is my mother, Mrs. Fein," and old Mrs. Fein rose and timidly extended her hand, Mrs. Brown merely looked at her and vaguely said, "Yes," and "You'll have to open the suitcases so that we can go through the things," and only then, as Mrs. Fein lowered her hand and her lip began to tremble, and Herb bent down to the suitcases, did Mrs. Brown recall her duty and she smiled faintly and said, "Haven't we met before, Mrs. Fein? I am sure we met somewhere."</p>
<p>But the tardy gesture of friendliness lasted a mere instant, for Mrs. Brown was distraught, and as Herbert opened the suitcases and Mrs. Fein bent over them as if to help him, Mrs. Brown said rather brusquely, "Take out all the things, put them on the chair there."</p>
<p>One by one the various articles were taken out of the suitcases and placed on the chair while Mrs. Brown watched the proceedings, and one item or another she ordered put aside. "This you can't keep; we must maintain a minimum of uniformity in the Home." And of some others she said: "These will have to be laundered. Put them in that hamper." But seeing the tears gather in old Mrs. Fein's eyes, she explained: "I know, dear, I know. Of course they are clean. But these are the rules of the house; for purposes of disinfection, you understand. And now you can put all the rest back in the suitcases and I'll have someone show you to your room. And yes," she added to Mrs. Fein, "please remember, there is to be no laundering of any kind in the room, nothing at all, not even handkerchiefs. If we were to permit it, every room would become a laundry."</p>
<p>Herb replaced his mother's possessions in the suitcases and snapped them shut. Mrs. Brown stepped outside into the hall and called to someone. A young woman attendant came in. "Show Mrs. Fein to room 24," she ordered her. And then to Herb: "When you deposit the suitcases you will please take your mother down to the office so that she can be properly registered." And as they walked out, she called to Herb: "Mr. Fein, by the time you are through at the office dinner will be served. Take your mother to the dining room, and you too be our guest for dinner tonight."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They followed the attendant down the hall to the big elevator, then slowly floated upward and emerged in the corridor on the second floor. They turned right and walked the length of the hall. Some old people wan­dered about. 'One or two turned to look at them inquiringly, and someone remarked, "That's the new one, for 24, where Mrs. Sylvan used to be," and paid them no more attention. When they reached room 24, the attendant merely nodded, "This is it; the bed on the right," and left them. The doorway to room 24 was blocked by a tall, gaunt woman in a flowered apron. She looked Mrs. Fein over critically and made no move. Herb, who had met her before when he was shown the room being assigned to his mother, did the honors. "Mrs. Harris, I want you to meet my mother, Mrs. Fein. She will be your roommate." Mrs. Harris still made no move and continued her critical survey of the two. "She will share the room with you," Herb added foolishly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harris said Hello and stepped into the room where she sat down on her bed and continued scrutinizing them. Mrs. Fein and her son entered and Herb began fussing around, first placing the suitcases in the corner, then moving them elsewhere, until he suddenly realized that his mother was still standing in her overcoat in the overheated room and he turned to her, "Mom, take your coat off; here, let me hang it up for you," and when he had done so, and Mrs. Harris still stared at them without saying a word, he took his mother to the window and pointed out, "See? What did I tell you? A corner location. You can see two streets from here." But the gloomy winter twilight had already darkened into early evening and all that could be seen was the expanse of greying snow.</p>
<p>With a curt "I'll see you later," Mrs. Harris rose and walked out. Casual small noises came from the hall. Herb went to the doorway, looked down the hall, and seeing no one nearby, he shut the door. Mother and son were now alone. Mrs. Fein sat down on her bed, thought of the unknown woman who had occupied it so recently, jumped up, then sat down again with a barely audible sign which could have signified resignation or simply tiredness, and invited Herb to sit on the chair nearby. She glanced for a moment at the other half of the room, at Mrs. Harris' neatly made bed, at her dresser with its load of photographs, at the open clothes closet that was full, at the waste basket with its fruit skins and wrapping paper, and then for an instant she surveyed her own side of the room, still so empty and untenanted, apparently so easy to walk away from, but was again aware of the impossibility of it and gained control of herself, and cheerfully said, "Well, this is it." Herb seized on the chance offered him. "Yes, yes, mother, you will be comfortable. Just wait and see." And then to the business at hand.</p>
<p>"You have the money with you?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I have it, a bank check, for one thousand dollars."</p>
<p>"Well, let us go down to the office and give it to them. I still say you should have kept some of it out--never mind the rules. But, anyway, don't worry, anytime you need anything, you know, I am right here.</p>
<p>They walked down the hall to the stairway. This time some people stopped to talk to them briefly. "You the new roomer? In 24? This your son? Glad to know you." And sensing Mrs. Fein's mood, or remembering the day of their own arrival, one or two added: "You'll be fine here. This is a good Home."</p>
<p>There was more activity and motion in the hall on the ground floor. Groups of old people clustered here and there talking while waiting for the dinner bell. From a few rooms came the sound of radios. On one side of the hall they passed a chapel, and then a large room that served as recreation hail and library. A bulletin board at the entrance announced a variety of activities and entertainments for the week. A folk singer was scheduled to perform that evening and an acrobat later. The Ladies' Auxiliary of the Home was scheduled to hold a meeting. Residents too sick or old to write their own letters were informed that a special committee of volunteer women would come on a certain afternoon to write their letters for them. Another announcement listed new books borrowed from the munici­pal library that were now available, and requested the return of others. There was also a schedule of religious services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They entered the office. A large executive desk near the window was unoccupied. At a smaller desk a secretary was talking on the phone. They patiently waited till she finished and turned to them.</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"This is my mother, Mrs. Fein," Herb said, and seeing the blank stare on the secretary's face, he added, "She just moved in, room 24."</p>
<p>The secretary opened a filing cabinet, withdrew some papers and glanced through them. "Did you bring the money? You were supposed to bring it here before you moved in."</p>
<p>Mrs. Fein took an envelope from her pocketbook and handed it to the young woman, who glanced at it briefly, clipped it to the other papers and put them in one of the desk drawers. "It's almost five-thirty," she said. "Come in tomorrow morning and we will fill out the necessary forms.</p>
<p>And she turned away.</p>
<p>Again they were out in the hall. Now the commotion was greater still as nearly everybody was out of his room waiting for the call to dinner. They went into the library and looked around briefly, then they glanced into the chapel, and then the dinner bell rang.</p>
<p>The dining room was in the basement floor. They followed the throng down the stairs while others waited for the elevator. It was a large, long room with windows at ground level and now banked with snow. There were three long rows of pale yellow formica-topped tables seating four each and now set for the meal. As they stood confused not knowing whether to take any available seat or whether seats were permanently assigned, Mrs. Brown, who supervised the serving, noticed their forlornness and led them to a table. "You can sit here," she said, "or any place you like. There is no permanent seating in the dining room." And she was off to her duties. Another man and a woman sat down at the table and greeted them with a nod. The man was very old. With trembling hands he took a soft roll from the plate in the center of the table and began tearing it into small pieces. He looked at Mrs. Fein, and then at Herb. "You are too young to be here," he said to Herb. "I have a son older than you; he is in business, furni­ture."</p>
<p>The other woman showed some interest.</p>
<p>"He is my son," Mrs. Fein said. "He is only visiting."</p>
<p>"Oh," the old man said, "A guest, good, good, a guest. Nice to see you, young man," and his mind wandered off.</p>
<p>Attendants wheeling carts served the food. There was thin soup, and when Herb tasted it, he automatically reached for a salt shaker, for it was bland, but there was no salt shaker on the table. He was prepared to over­look the matter, but the woman across the table had noticed his gesture and now shouted to one of the waitresses: "Girl! You Bring some salt here, for the young man." And to Herb she explained: "They put no salt on the tables unless you ask for it. And they put little of it in the food. Lots of people here have high blood pressure." And again she shouted: "Girl! You Bring the salt." Until finally someone did bring a salt shaker. And then there was well cooked meat and mashed potatoes and finally crumbly cookies and very pale tea and milk with which to dilute it still further. Mrs. Fein picked at her food dispiritedly. Herb pretended to eat with gusto, frequently urging his mother on.</p>
<p>As the tea was served, the atmosphere in the dining room relaxed and from here and there, over the hubbub of conversation and an occasional sigh or belch, there were heard complaints about the tea. And even as the old people added large quantities of milk to the pale liquid, they protested against its weakness and recalled far off days, at home, when they brewed their own tea which was strong and aromatic and young even as they had been then. But the clatter of the dishes being picked up from the tables grew louder as the waitresses hurried to finish their work, and the old people began to rise and wander slowly to the stairs and to the elevator. They were fed and content for the moment, and there was a long evening ahead with little to do, and few if any visitors could be expected on such a cold night to break the monotony. The folk singer, to be sure, was scheduled for this evening, but that was later, at eight, and meantime there was nothing except satiety and resting and perhaps a bit of gossiping in the corridors.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fein and her son rose and went up to her room. Mrs. Harris was already there and seemed to be waiting for them. "Well? How did you like the dinner?" she greeted them. "Dishwater! Slops! That's what it is. Won't give a person a decent meal! Something got to be done about it." But finding no response she got up and walked out.</p>
<p>Herb unpacked the suitcases and helped his mother distribute their contents in the dresser and closet. Finished with this he suggested that he stay and later take her to the concert downstairs. But Mrs. Fein would not hear of it, and pleading tiredness asked him not to stay. He all too readily agreed and kissed her lightly on the forehead and when out promis­ing to call her the very next morning.</p>

<p class=subtitle>III</p>
<p>"I am really beginning to like it here," Mrs. Fein said one month later when Herb and Jean and their children were visiting her—not for the first time of course, for Herb had been coming almost every day the first two weeks that his mother was in the Home, and Jean too had visited Mrs. Fein before. "I'm really beginning to like it here," Mrs. Fein repeated this phrase which she had said several times before during the first month of her residence. But now she half agreed with herself while all the other times she had only tried to reassure her son.</p>
<p>Indeed, it hadn't turned out to be so bad, after the first night that is, for then, as soon as Herb had gone, Mrs. Harris returned to the room, sat down on her bed and without any preliminaries, announced: "She died of cancer; Mrs. Sylvan, the woman who had your bed before you."</p>
<p>"Oh! I am so sorry to hear that," Mrs. Fein said and frantically searched her mind, exhausted after the experiences of the day, for some other subject of conversation. But before she could think of anything else to say, Mrs. Harris resumed: "She was old all right; said she was eighty-three, but I knew better—must have been closer to ninety. Oh well. How old are you?" she asked and smoothed some folds in her flowered apron as she stared critically at Mrs. Fein.</p>
<p>"I am seventy-eight," Mrs. Fein replied, uncomfortable at the tone of interrogation.</p>
<p>"And this young man, your son, is he your only son?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I have two daughters," Mrs. Harris declared. "I am eighty-one and my daughters live on the West Coast."</p>
<p>"How nice."</p>
<p>"What's nice about it?" Mrs. Harris frowned. "They come to see me only once a year. They won't come again till next July."</p>
<p>"Oh," Mrs. Fein was apologetic.</p>
<p>"But they send me lots of things; I get packages every month."</p>
<p>"Indeed," Mrs. Fein said neutrally, fearing to offend again.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harris got up and looked suspiciously down the hall, then returned and whispered ominously. "But most of it gets stolen. You are new here; be careful. There are a lot of thieves on this floor. They steal things right out of your closet. See what I mean?"</p>
<p>"Indeed? It's unbelievable."</p>
<p>"It's true," Mrs. Harris straightened rigidly and stared sharply at Mrs. Fein. "It's true and you must be careful. They come prowling around at night. I hear them opening my dresser and closet. I pretend to be asleep, or they might kill me. If you hear any prowlers in the room at night, you too keep still, or they might kill you."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Indeed I will," Mrs. Fein said, now thoroughly upset, and rose from her bed. She edged to the door, smiled painfully at Mrs. Harris, and quickly walked toward the stairs and down to the ground floor. She went into the recreation hall where a handful of people milled around and only casually glanced at her. She found a newspaper lying on a table, picked it up and tried to read it, but her eyes filmed over with tears of fear and abandonment, and thus she sat not knowing how long, turning over wild plans in her mind, and one moment she almost decided to go to the hall telephone and call Herb and implore him to come out at once and take her to his home, to plead with him, to cry, to threaten a scandal if necessary; and the next moment she realized that were she to do so Herb would indeed come out but under no circumstances would he take her to his home, but would only talk to her and try to calm her and maybe go to the office, if it was still open, or to Mrs. Brown, or to the resident nurse and describe her plight to them and ask their help, have them talk to her or maybe give her a tranquil­izer, and one of them would come and disapprovingly, gracelessly, almost cruelly, try to talk sense to her, try to calm her as quickly as possible, for it was evening now and their day's work was over and they too were entitled to some hours of rest by themselves, and at best, with an impa­tient shrug of the shoulders they would take her to the infirmary and give her two, instead of one, tranquilizing pills, then take her to her room, room 24 shared with Mrs. Harris, who was still there awake and about. And many people would notice and see and look at her and ask questions, Who is this? What is the matter with her? themselves fearful that some­thing serious was happening to an old woman and they were all old men and women, and it could happen to them, whatever it was--only to be informed that, It is nothing, just the new roomer in 24, you know, where Mrs. Sylvan used to be, it's her first night here and she's nervous--and they would relax, and smile knowingly and condescendingly, for they had been through this 'and had survived it, so it was now a laughing matter, and they could afford to feel superior; or someone might say, Oh, Mrs. Harris' roommate, no wonder. But only she, old Mrs. Fein, would be the focus of their ridicule.</p>
<p>And then it seemed to her that if she were to put on her coat and go out, for it was still quite early in the evening, and call a taxi, and then, and then, well, she could say, To whom?, to a policeman, that she had lost the key to her apartment and they would come and pry the door open for her because she was a nice old lady who had lost her keys on a cold winter day when they fell out of her chilled old hands and sank into the snow, or something like that, or she had dropped them somewhere not remembering where, only that, when they had opened the door and with the strong beam of their flashlight found the light switch and turned it on and seen that the apartment was empty and no longer tenanted, why that wouldn't do at all, of course, and they would quickly get her story and bring her back to the Home, and it would be still worse, for everyone would stare and ask ques­tions and she would be interrogated and pacified and put to bed and people would ask, What is the matter with her? Not in her right mind, that new woman in 24, some might say. But why the police? Had she done anything? And Mrs. Harris, gaunt and towering in her flowered apron, pointing an accusing finger; It's she! She stole my dress, the one my daughter just sent me! She stole it and cut it up into pieces! I know! I saw her do it!</p>
<p>Then what was she to do? Perhaps just stay where she was and then the hall would fill with people and the singer would give his concert, and when he had finished they would all retire to their rooms, but she could stay in the hall, huddle in some corner so that no one would notice her until finally the lights would be turned out and she would be left alone. But that would not do either, for someone was bound to discover her. So what was she to do?</p>
<p>But meanwhile the hall began to fill slowly, and without knowing it, bowed figure of grief that she was, she did attract the close attention of one, a certain Mrs. Godin, who noticed her, discreetly inquired who she was, and at once understood and went up and introduced herself, and just as quickly called over two or three others, and introduced them, so that Mrs. Fein had to raise her head and be couteous, as was her nature to be, and Mrs. Godin suggested that since the concert would not start for a while yet, why shouldn't they go to her room which was almost directly across the hall, and as she had an electric plate and some dishes and all other things required, she would make some tea and they would visit. And the thunderhead of terror in Mrs. Fein's mind began to break up and dissolve, leaving only a thin haze of apprehension, and when they sat down in Mrs. Godin's room, which was bright with extra floor lamps, the last mist of unease disappeared and they talked of children, and of life, and of snow that was white instead of grey. When the concert was about to begin, they all entered the hall in a group and sat together and the folk songs which the singer sang were a solace.</p>
<p>And later, when Mrs. Godin escorted old Mrs. Fein to her room on the second floor, even Mrs. Harris, who was already there and grumbling about something, had lost much of her terror.</p>
<p>	Thus it was that a month after entering the Home, Mrs. Fein could say to her son and daughter-in-law that she was beginning to like her sit­uation, but still she only half agreed with her own words, and what she really meant was that she was partly becoming reconciled to her new way of life; but what she did not herself understand or even distinctly know was that a hope had been born within her of a life after this life.</p>

<p class=subtitle>IV</p>
<p>Spring brought many changes and improvements. As the snow melted and the lawns turned green, a new spirit of animation came over the Home. The healthy residents now became more mobile as walking outside became safe and no longer presented perpetual danger of slipping on the ice and falling and breaking a bone. It was also easier to go by themselves to other parts of town to do light shopping or simply to visit. The prospect of waiting for a bus in zero weather had kept almost all of them, even the youngest, indoors during the winter. Now the world opened up before them. It was pleasant merely to sit in the sun on a bench on the lawn. The cor­ridors inside the Home were now frequently entirely abandoned as even the wheelchair cases were taken outside for a sunning. Only the very oldest, the sick and senile remained in their rooms. Sons and daughters and in-laws now drove up on weekends not merely to visit with the old folks, but to take them in their cars to their own homes or to picnics.</p>
<p>That spring also brought a change in administration and a new young Director who was full of ideas for the greater happiness of the old people. Occupational therapy was the thing needed, he insisted when addressing a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Home, emphasizing his points by rhythmically tapping his pencil on the table. You can't make old people young, some of the Board members objected. But you can make them healthier and happier, the Director beamed. And he was given his way.</p>
<p>An annex of the basement was transformed into a laundry room for those who cared to use it, equipped with sinks, washing machines, dryers and drying racks. Ironing boards and irons were provided. And a big sign proclaimed: "All laundering must be done in the laundry room only." A corner of the extensive lawn was plowed up and divided into small plots and old men were encouraged to plant vegetables and flowers and to tend them. A number of young fruit trees were planted and their care was assigned to volunteers.</p>
<p>And as the days were both long and warm, most of the people swarmed outside also after the evening meal and indoor entertainment was reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>Almost, it seemed to Mrs. Fein, like living on one's own, and even better in some ways, for Mrs. Godin, though much younger than-herself, had become both friend and mentor, and she had also established friendly rela­tions with a number of other old people. Company was now at hand and did not have to be sought, as was the case when she lived alone after her hus­band died. Late afternoons, when she awoke from her nap, all she had to do was go outside and there were people she knew and could talk to. Some, to be sure, had to be avoided, like her roommate, Mrs. Harris, who now protested loudly to everyone that enemies were throwing dirt or dye into the sink where she did her laundry, or the unpleasant old man from the first floor who moved from one bench to another, sidling up to aged women, and with lewd and knowing smirks suggested indecent doings, past or current. But the lawn was huge and the benches numerous and scattered about, so that  it was easy to avoid those who were unpleasant. And fears and sorrows seemed to dissolve or at least to thin out in the open air, once they were taken out of the confining rooms and restricting corridors. The moaning of the sick woman in her bed, the loose babble of the senile man standing at the head of the stairs, the secretive whisper of another seeking to impart some dread information about his calamitous condition receded to the privacy of their owners. They aroused sympathy, but did not impose their burden of painful knowledge on all others.</p>
<p>Herb and Jean and their children now paid regular visits to Mrs. Fein on weekends and these were usually pleasant, not as during the cold weather when the visiting had to be done in the lounge, and many stiff old fingers reached out to caress smooth young flesh--Co e here, little boy, come here, I'll give you a penny--seeking impossible rejuvenation from contact with the young, caressing a frightened cheek or head that tried to flee the terrifying, ravenous love, only to be met with cantankerous senile complaints from others, already too deep in their twilight and resenting its violation--Go away, you bad boy; don't make so much noise--finally re­bounding to Herb and Jean: Let's go home, ma; I don't want to stay here. Let's go home now. For now even the children enjoyed the visits, romping about the lawn, examining the vegetable beds and sampling their immature growths, and if some old man felt outraged by what he regarded as vanda­lism to his particular plot, to his estate, his anger was dissipated under the endless blue sky and the children only ran to play somewhere else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And for a brief moment there was even the illusion of youth and of romance, for one day a messenger delivered a bouquet for Mrs. Godin bear­ing a card "From Your Secret Admirer," and, as could have been expected, word of the tribute spread rapidly from one bench to another and there was much speculation about the identity of the swain, and the younger residents joked about the possibility of marriage and wedded bliss, the first ever to happen within the Home. Curiosity and gossip mounted when the first bouquet was followed by another and still another at approximately weekly intervals, all bearing the same cryptic message. The bus stop near the Home was watched, especially by the old man who was in the habit of making prurient suggestions about other residents. Who from the Home was making regular trips downtown? Suspicion fell first on one and then on another, but when the bouquets stopped coming after a while, and the summer wore on into August, the matter was forgotten.</p>
<p>The mood of animation subsided. The season began to exert a depress­ing effect. In the heat of August the residents of the Home began to shun the scorching outdoors. The vegetable plots were ripening quickly and re­quired no more attention. Now and then some old man, who had. proudly tended his few square feet in June, would pull up a bunch of carrots or of beets, look at them approvingly, but having no use for them himself would give them to the kitchen. The spurt of life of early summer was quietly ebbing away. Sons and daughters who lived far away had already paid their annual visits and the flurry of excitement was at an end, not to be repeated until another autumn, long winter and spring had been survived, and vague appre­hension set in the Home. Who would survive till the following summer? This was bound to be the last summer for many. Who were they? Could they still, before the cold rains and first snow flurries set in, escape from this place where their fate was sealed?</p>
<p>	It was on an afternoon late in August that Mrs. Harris appeared before a group sitting quietly, some lightly dozing, on the benches on the lawn. As usual she wore a flowered apron and her face was grim as she announced: "I saw it, I saw it with my own eyes. She was beating her."</p>
<p>"Who? What?" There was more surprise than curiosity, for Mrs. </p>
<p>Harris' standard complaint had to do with alleged thieving on the premises.</p>
<p>"I saw it with my own eyes," Mrs. Harris was rigid with indignation. "The attendant, the freckled one, she was beating Mrs. Goodman, on the second floor."</p>
<p>"Why was she beating her?" someone asked.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Goodman spilled some medicine she was giving her, so she beat her, slapped her face, then knocked her down, told her not to get out of bed till dinner."</p>
<p>"Why didn't she go to complain to the office?"</p>
<p>"Complain? Complain?" Mrs. Harris shrieked. "To those thieves in the office? The attendant would kill her for it." And she stalked off.</p>
<p>"Crazy, that woman," someone remarked without conviction. But others wondered.</p>
<p>For summer was over and they were older than in the spring; soon the Home floating on its knoll would suck them in from the lawn and swal­low them for the winter, handing them out one by one as they died.</p>

<p class=subtitle>V</p>
<p>In October the cold rains began and quickly turned to sleet. Morn­ings the slush lay on the still green grass under a lowering sky. Raw winds tossed the branches violently, ripping off the remaining oak leaves. The residents of the Home stayed indoors. Some of the women occupied themselves with a new project started by the Director--knitting. Mostly they knitted pot holders; a few younger or more ambitious ones knitted scarves. These were later sold by the Ladies Auxiliary at its annual bazaar and the proceeds were used to finance a party or two around New Year time. The old men, with nothing to occupy them, slept much during the days, wandered around the corridors and frequently engaged in pointless arguments with each other, and when they tired of these they sat in the lounges repeating to each other ancient incidents from their lives which they embellished and modified with each telling, until they created frag­mentary new biographies for themselves.</p>
<p>The season of ailments was at hand and one after another came down with respiratory diseases. Old Dr. Sloan was kept busy prescribing anti­biotics, administering injections and ordering rest and more rest, while his patients fretted, fearing that this might be their last ailment. Harried by their additional duties the attendants became ever more irrit­able and impatient with their old charges.</p>
<p>"There now, be a good boy, up we go," and a shrivelled old man's body would be propped to a sitting position. A couple of pills and a sip of water, and then his pillow fluffed, and he would be given a quick pat and sink back into a stupor as the tranquilizers took effect. Or, "How are we this morning, dearie? Come now, sit up and we'll put nice fresh sheets on this bed. My, but you look grand today, a real beauty, couldn't have looked better on your wedding day." And with quick and sometimes rough motions the old woman would be moved deftly this way and that, the old sheet taken down, a new one spread, and the patient given her medicine, more often than not merely a tranquilizer, and put back to bed. For in the infirmary, as he wrote out his prescriptions, entered notations on the charts and gave instructions to the resident nurse, Dr. Sloan shrugged his shoulders with resignation. Peace was what they needed, for they were old, and much individual care could not be given them. Always short of help and with a great turnover of staff, the Home could do only what was essential and the dreads of the old patients could not be indulged, for they were often unreasonable, for what they wanted most was constant re­assurance that this was not it yet. Therefore sleep was best for them in every way, until they would be roused at meal time, fed, and quickly nudged into sleep once more.</p>
<p>And those whose illnesses were serious were taken to the municipal hospital, while the healthy ones, sitting in their lounges and looking outside, would see the ambulance pull up before the entrance now and again, take its horizontal load on a stretcher and drive off. Then heads would nod fearfully. And sometimes the patients returned after some days, or even after a week or two, and other times they would not return. And those who returned came back almost as newcomers, for frequently they were for­gotten almost as soon as they were taken away, and they had tales to tell and were listened to eagerly as after a fearful adventure.</p>
<p>It was at this time that Mrs. Fein suffered a stroke which paralyzed her right side. Well after midnight she suddenly awoke in great terror. She felt no pain but it seemed to her that someone or something was heavily pressing the right side of her body against the mattress. She struggled against this pressure, to sit up, or at least to turn, but could not. She wanted to cry out for help but her shriek died in her mouth and only a suppressed gurgle rattled in her throat as she squirmed helplessly. In terror she soon gave up her attempts to move, afraid that the crushing weight would descend all over her, and thus she lay till morning and heard her roommate, Mrs. Harris, awake with her usual complaint: "They were here again, the thieves; I heard them. Didn't you hear them at all?" she turned to Mrs. Fein. And getting no answer she stalked into the bath­room and slammed the door after her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mrs. Fein's condition was only discovered later, when an attendant came to clean the room and saw her plight and, herself frightened, ran to inform the nurse in the infirmary. Dr. Sloan was called urgently to come to examine her, and when she failed to respond to the measures he applied, Herb was called and arrangements were made to have her taken to the hos­pital. Her son and Mrs. Godin went with her in the ambulance, and stayed with her as long as they were permitted and tried to comfort her, but she could not respond and showed her terror by the spasmodic movements of her left arm and by pleading looks.</p>
<p>She recovered to a considerable extent and returned to the Home three weeks later, but now she could not walk without much assistance, nor sit upright unaided, and the attendant would, when she had time, put her in a soft chair and strap her to it so that she would not fall out of it and injure herself, and thus she would sit, sometimes abandoned for a long time, until someone was free to unfasten her and help her back to bed. She was fed on a little table that was moved close to her bed, and, left alone, her head often slumped to the table, crumbs getting into her hair, and she was unable to lift it herself.</p>
<p>Herb now came to visit her more frequently, on evenings during the week, and also on weekends. But not the children who after a visit or two began to dread this apparition of a grandmother, so that rather than force them to a duty they resented, Herb and Jean decided not to bring them to the Home.</p>
<p>And indeed it would have served no purpose to force the children to visit, for Mrs. Fein had undergone a profound change and entered a condi­tion in which grandchildren no longer belonged. She often shed soundless tears when her son was with her and looked pleadingly at him, for she could talk with difficulty only, and once, as he patted her shoulder re­assuringly, she moved his hand to her lips and kissed it imploringly.</p>
<p>"What are you doing, Mother?" he sharply pulled his hand away.</p>
<p>"Herb, Herbie, you always were a good son," was all she said.</p>
<p>And he guessed what she wished to say, and one moment he thought, My God! My God! and the next, What can I do?</p>
<p>But it was not till some weeks later, as he was about to bid her goodby, that unexpectedly and in an earnest tone she articulated with dif­ficulty: "Herbie, take me home with you."</p>
<p>"What are you saying, Mother. You know you are ill. Now, when you get well. . ."</p>
<p>She stared at him and seemed to forget her request. And he left.</p>

<p class=subtitle>VI</p>
<p>One night a short time later old Mrs. Fein had a strange dream. There were many people, there was music—it was a wedding. The music woke her into her dream, and it was her wedding. Yet in the crowd of guests she was alone and looking for someone, for her groom, of course, and she could not find him. With growing exasperation quickly turning to frenzied fear she shoved her way forward until at last she saw him some distance away. But it was not the man who had been her husband all her married life; instead it was a resident of the Home who lived on the ground floor. She was not at all surprised at this. It was the man who had sent bouquets during the summer. "I knew all along it was you, she said. "I am so glad I found you at last." "Where have you been?" he asked. "Every­body has been looking for you. The ceremony is about to start." "I was in the hospital," she said. He took her by the arm and unbearable happi­ness surged through her. But the gladness that filled her quickly dissolved and gave way to a great anxiety. The wedding party melted away. She was alone and terribly worried. Her son--not Herbie, but another boy who was somehow her son--had gone out from the house and lost his way. She could visualize him clearly, though she could not see his face, standing on a street corner and crying, for he was only a boy of eight, and many people passed by him yet nobody took compassion on the crying child to ask what his trouble was and to bring him home, and she was tormented by the thought, Why doesn't someone do something about the lost boy? And then this, too, faded and gave way to quiet assurance. The boy would find his way after all; her son would come back. And she slept peacefully.</p>
<p>The following day, when Mrs. Godin came to visit her as usual, Mrs. Fein was in a more cheerful mood than she had been for some time, and even her articulation was noticeably improved. Altogether she looked like a person who had heard some good news. And when Mrs. Godin expressed her admiration for Mrs. Fein's great improvement and assured her of a complete and early recovery, Mrs. Fein asked to be helped into her chair.</p>
<p>"I want to ask a great favor of you," she began.</p>
<p>"Of course, dear, of course. What is it you want?"</p>
<p>"I want you to write a letter for me," Mrs. Fein said. "To my son," she added in a confidential tone.</p>
<p>"To Herbie?" Mrs. Godin wondered. "Why, I will call him for you and he will come. Or I can wheel you to the phone and you can talk to him." "No, not Herbie, my other son, the younger one."</p>
<p>"Oh," Mrs. Godin was perplexed.</p>
<p>"I have another son. You didn't know; I married again; I have a younger son. Herbie is a good boy. But I want to write to my younger son."</p>
<p>"Why this is wonderful, you never told me about it. Where is your younger son?"</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Fein's face clouded with a strained expression. She appeared to be trying to recall something that eluded her, and she said: "He has been away a long time. He doesn't know I am here."</p>
<p>"Where does he live?"</p>
<p>"Where he lives?" the strain on Mrs. Fein's face became more pro­nounced. "He lives, well, you know, on the coast. You write this letter for me. He will come and take me out of here. He will take me to live with him."</p>
<p>"Do you have his address?"</p>
<p>"Address?" she looked bewildered. "He lives on the coast." And then, confidentially, "He is a doctor, a very famous doctor. He cures everybody. You know." she added in a whisper, "when he was a boy he once got lost, couldn't find his way home."</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>	"You write this letter for me. Yes? He will come and take me with him."</p>
