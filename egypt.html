    <h1>Jacob in Egypt</h1>
    <p class=topnote>[Jewish Frontier, October 1946, p.19-28]</p>

<p>IT WOULD SEEM that there is nothing more to add to the story of Jacob's sojourn in Egypt as we know it. The sunlit simplicity of the Bible narra­tive concerning this phase of Jacob's life has a somewhat soporific effect. The reader, emotionally exhausted by the previous tensions and resolutions in Jacob's dramatic life, expects nothing more along that line and considers the story of Jacob as closed.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the Biblical account when Jacob finally met Joseph in the flesh after their long separation, he exclaimed: "Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive." In a sense he did die at that moment, for his life found a conclusion in the recovery of his lost son. From that point on Jacob might have been expected to lack an active goal—and he receded into the background. He ap­peared once more in the Biblical action, but that was only to bless his sons before his death.</p>
<p>Yet, we must not be misled to believe that his emotional powers declined, or that his inner life was peaceful. On the contrary, the few short chapters that deal with the last years of Jacob-Israel thinly veil a deep-hidden tragedy in his life. But since Jacob was an old man, history, which had shown such great concern with his former doing and tribulations, seemed to have lost interest in him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FROM the moment many years before when Jacob was informed that Joseph had been devoured by a wild beast, death became an obsession in his mind, an obsession connected with rediscovering Joseph. At that moment he exclaimed: "I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning." In his grief, life seemed no longer worth living, and since Joseph appeared to be dead beyond all doubt, there was nothing for Jacob to do but descend to him.</p>
<p>The edge of his grief was no doubt blunted by the years. This was partly the mere effect of time. But partly it was a result of Jacob's visionary dis­position. A man of his dreams was not likely to accept the inevitability of death, especially of the death of one so dear to him. He would compensate for it in some way. He compensated for Rachel's death by an ever present sense of guilt. Hence his recurring remark, on appropriate as well as on incongruous occasions, to the effect that "as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath; and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath..." In the case of Joseph he appears to have refused to accept the reality of death after the first peak of anguish wore off. Legend relates that little Serach kept singing to him: "Joseph is yet alive" for many years before Joseph was rediscovered. The old man might even have suggested this to her. This little game with his granddaughter provided an opportunity to indulge in his day dreams about Joseph's being alive and their meeting again some day.</p>
<p>What would Jacob say when he would finally meet Joseph? The old man must have practiced the scene, and his part in it, many times. The phrase he spoke when at last he did meet Joseph is too polished and dramatic to have been extemporaneous: "Now let me die for I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive." It naturally referred to death since he had vowed long before to go down "into the grave unto his son."</p>
<p>The great dramatic moment of which he had dreamed all those years finally came; Jacob spoke his formal little speech to his son and then departed to his appointed dwelling in Goshen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THAT IS practically all the Bible tells us explicitly. But many gaps remain to be filled in, otherwise Jacob's story remains incomplete and some of his later words and actions appear incomprehensible. What happened to Jacob during the seventeen years of his life in Egypt? How did he become adjusted to the green land of Goshen after the stern hills of Hebron? The answer to these questions is implied in his actions.</p>
<p>The following scene, although the references to it are confused chronologically, must have occurred during the first days after Jacob's arrival in Egypt when he was still in a slightly dazed and exalted frame of mind at the way his dreams and the songs of little Serach turned into reality. Joseph came to see his father and brought his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, to introduce them to Jacob. Joseph, in his princely Egyptian garb, presented something of a dilemma to Jacob, a dilemma which was at the root of his later unhappiness. He recognized his son, in many little ways implied in the term "recognition." But he also sensed a stranger in him. Joseph was two persons. He was the beloved son and at the same time a stranger, an Egyptian prince, a high-ranking goy toward whom Israel from provincial Hebron felt both a touch of xenophobia as well as the deference due to those who wield power. At that time, during Jacob's first months in Egypt, this con­flicting attitude toward his son was still vague although he was already uncomfortably conscious of it. But when Joseph brought his two boys before Jacob, the old man looked at them in some amaze­ment.</p>
<p>"Who are these?" he asked.</p>
<p>This was an involuntary exclamation. Jacob knew very well who they were. Who could these boys, whom Joseph was leading toward him, be but his grandsons? But the sight of the two children, little Egyptians, aroused an instantaneous, involuntary revulsion within him. They appeared alien to him. They were little goyim. And although the old man could clearly see who they were, the rude phrase, "Who are these?" escaped him.</p>
<p>Joseph ignored the rudeness of the question, which should not have been asked even if Jacob had not known who the boys were. But his answer was somewhat belligerent: "They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place."</p>
<p>By this time Jacob had regained his composure. He had a phrase prepared for this occasion too, a phrase nurtured through many years. It was only the shock of the realization that these two little Egyptians were actually his grandchildren, the seed Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that had momentarily made him forget his manners. During all those years when he was dreaming that Joseph might still, against all reason, be alive, and practicing what he would say were he ever to see him again, Jacob times became aware that time was passing and that, when found, Joseph would be older and might the father of children. At such times, when his mind digressed from its concentration on Joseph to the contemplation of the reunion in which children might figure, he also practiced a phrase to suit this aspect of the occasion. He tried out many phrases and finally chose the following: "I had not thought to see thy face and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed." It sounded good. It was a little formal, even stilted perhaps. But none of the emotional energy that he concentrated on his lost son could possibly bestow on children whose existence was problematical and whose sex was unknown. On those rare occasions when he did think of Joseph's possible children he invariably visualized them as little Israelites, like his other grandchildren, little shepherds; sunburnt and obedient. Now that he was brought back to reality by Joseph's remark tinged with hauteur, Jacob hastened to repeat the phrase that he held stored in his mind for this occasion which had turned out so differently from what he had visualized in his dreams.</p>
<p>The rest of the interview is not related in Genesis, but it must have been somewhat as follows. Courtesy as well as paternal interest compelled Jacob to ask the names of the two little Egyptians, who, despite visual evidence, were without doubt his grandsons.</p>
<p>"The older is named Manasseh; the younger one Ephraim," Joseph informed him.</p>
<p>"Manasseh and Ephraim, Manasseh and Ephraim," Jacob repeated, approving yet slightly dubious. "They are good names, good Israelite names, my son, but. . ."</p>
<p>"What, father?" Joseph asked kindly, intuitively aware that something was troubling the old man.</p>
<p>The name Manasseh aroused a painful doubt in Jacob's mind. Manasseh—"forgetting." What could Joseph have meant by thus naming his first son? He ached to ask the question yet dared not.</p>
<p>"Yes, father," Joseph prompted him.</p>
<p>Jacob decided to postpone the troubling question and asked instead: "Why did you name the younger one Ephraim?"</p>
<p>"Because God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction," Joseph answered with a smile. And he thought: What a strange man my father is! Always looking for hidden meanings, for symbols, in everything. So that was troubling him, the meaning of his grandsons' names.</p>
<p>"And the older one?" Jacob asked.</p>
<p>"Manasseh?" Joseph was unaware that his father was holding his breath for fear of what he might hear. "I named him Manasseh 'For God had made me forget all my toil and all my father's house.' " A slight tremor shook Jacob's body. He partly rose from his seat, then sat down again. He looked at Joseph for a moment, then lowered his eyes, not wishing to display his pain before his son.</p>
<p>But that brief glance was understood by Joseph. The smile departed from his lips.</p>
<p>"Father," he hastened to explain, "it is not as you think. Do not take it amiss and let me explain. It not because I really forgot that I named him Manasseh. Indeed, the very fact that I named him thus is ultimate proof that I had not forgotten you, and the brothers. For were I to have forgotten and were my father's house to have become obliterated from my memory, would I have dwelt on this subject to the extent of naming my first-born thus?"</p>
<p>Jacob's eyes remained lowered and tears coursed down his old, wrinkled cheeks. The anxious avalanche of Joseph's words appeared to have made no impression upon his mind. His lips moved silently. His brain refused to confront the full meaning of the situation and, as on many former occasions, it fled far back in time. Without sound Jacob was saying to himself: "When I came from Padan, Rachel died by me, when yet there was but a little way unto Ephrath. And I buried her there . . . And I buried her there . . ."</p>
<p>"But he was my first one," Joseph continued, "and it was natural that I should rejoice, for my own sake as well as for your sake. For through his birth I raised up seed not only to myself but also to you. And if one could have considered the possibility, the vague possibility, of forgetting before he was born, it could not even be thought of after he came. Because then I, the lost son, ceased to be such and became a link in the chain of generations stretching from you, father, to eternity and the blessing of the Lord in that eternity. Only in this sense, father, must you understand the name I chose."</p>
<p>Jacob's thoughts gradually relaxed their frantic grip on the past and came to rest uneasily on the present. He looked up to Joseph's pleading eyes, he glanced at the boys standing in self-conscious confusion and a sigh escaped him. There was resignation and sadness in that sigh. The tears continued to course down his cheeks. Something had broken in the old man. Time would tell the full extent of the damage done by the shock he had suffered. But for the present he realized that it was necessary for him to return to the scene of the interview. Joseph's arguments did not convince him. As a matter of fact he did not even hear most of the things his son was saying, so far into the past had his thoughts retreated. Only the general idea of the second half of Joseph's speech registered on his mind. He also realized that there would be no point in pursuing the subject any further at the time. He would only succeed in hurt­ing Joseph's feelings.</p>
<p>"Yes, my son, I understand," he said to Joseph. "It is as you say. You spoke of the blessing. Indeed; 'God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz . . . and blessed me and said unto me, behold ... I will make of thee a multitude of people . . . ' I understand your rejoicing for my sake at the birth of Manasseh. Indeed 'thy two sons . . . which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt . . . are mine, as Reuben and Simeon they shall be mine.' "</p>
<p>It was a labored and unpracticed speech that Jacob made. He had not prepared for such an eventuality. But it was necessary to put an end to the interview somehow. It was also necessary for him to be alone to weigh this matter and examine it from all angles. Such was Jacob's nature. He could not leave a fact or an idea, painful or happy, to stand by itself. It had to be mulled over and integrated into the totality of his being. It had to be made part of himself and wrought into the pattern which his life represented. For this, solitude was required.</p>
<p>Joseph and Jacob bade each other farewell. The two little Egyptian boys had remained standing decorously but impatiently throughout the interview of which they understood nothing. They were anxious for it to be over and felt relieved when they saw it was about to end. Joseph nudged them to go up and say goodbye to their grandfather. They did so, speaking words which the old man did not under­stand, first Manasseh, who received a pat on the shoulder from Jacob's hand and returned to Joseph's side, then Ephraim. But as the younger boy finished his little speech of farewell and well wishing, Jacob took his soft young hand in his own and gazed deeply into the childish eyes. He was struck by the resemblance, or the imagined resemblance, between them and Rachel's eyes. The child was embarrassed and lowered his eyelids. Joseph, too, was embarrassed, unable to guess what Jacob might possibly say now, but sensing that it would be something painful. Jacob broke his silence after a moment. He smiled at the boy as if trying to ingratiate himself into his favor. "Ephraim is a dear son to me," he said. "Ephraim is my pet child. Every time I speak of you, my bowels will yearn for you." He let go the child's hand and Ephraim hastily retreated to avoid further outbreaks of emotion. Only Joseph understood what Jacob had said, but he decided to make no comment.</p>
<p>Then they parted. Joseph returned to his palace and Jacob stayed with his sons in Goshen. The transformation his thoughts underwent during the subse­quent years we can gather only by a careful examina­tion of two or three passages on the basis of which it is possible to reconstruct the trend of his inner development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IT WOULD appear that Jacob's emotional upset over the choice of Manasseh as the name for Joseph's first born had serious repercussions. The subject con­tinued to trouble him after he returned to the house assigned to him in Goshen. He could not get over it. The thought kept buzzing in his head: "Joseph had forgotten me! Joseph had forgotten me! All those years that I wept for him and dreamed of him, my son, my Joseph, had ceased to remember me." One thought led to another, not always along logical lines, until Jacob was overcome with the idea that: "Joseph is dead."</p>
<p>Throughout the years that Joseph had been dead, to the best of Jacob's knowledge, he refused to accept the thought. Now that Joseph had been found alive, Jacob became obsessed with the idea that he was dead. Age, of course, might have had something to do with this obsession. And Jacob was getting to be quite an old man. But it would be erroneous to ascribe this only to age. This obsession was not on the practical plane of fact. Jacob knew very well that Joseph was alive in his palace, and although Genesis mentions no visits of the son to his father until the latter was on the verge of death, it may be assumed that Joseph did visit him from time to time. It was on an entirely different level that this realization obsessed Jacob. He had recovered his son in the flesh and by that very means he had lost him in the spirit. His dream image of Joseph, which he had patiently developed during the years of his loss, could not coexist with the real Joseph who was in charge of Egypt's granaries. One or the other had to go. And like any phantom of the night that van­ishes with the coming of daylight, the dream Joseph died with the appearance of the real Joseph on the scene.</p>
<p>But having lost the dream, Jacob lost everything. In this sense his advancing age may be held respon­sible for his obsession. Had he been younger and still leading an active life, he might have compromised with the new Joseph. Everyday cares and activities might have forced him to make such a compromise, although even this is not certain. For a man of Jacob's type ideas and dream images are far more real than the reality of the flesh. And what could possibly unite him with the real Joseph? Only the past could to some extent have bridged the gap between Jacob-Israel and Joseph the Egyptian prince. But this possible bridge was destroyed by Joseph when he named his first born son Manasseh—to note that he had forgotten his father's house.</p>
<p>It rankled in Jacob's breast. "Joseph had forgotten me," and "Joseph is dead," became interchangeable in his mind. Then, quite logically, there arose the question: "What am I doing here in Egypt?" A question to which he had no answer and to which he would have vehemently refused a positive answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JACOB'S attitude toward Egypt is known to been strongly negative. Nothing—except Joseph—not even the famine would have persuaded him go to Egypt. Asses and mules and camels could have brought him the necessary food from Egypt. He had an unconcealed aversion for the country. It represented not only the land of idolatry—Sheol—but also the land of social shapelessness in his mind. Egypt was prosperous. Egypt had big cities. Egypt had mobs. Jacob, the patriarch, wanted none these. Traders went to Egypt—let them. He was a shepherd prince, not a salesman. Now and then a slave from Hebron or Schechem would run away from his master and flee to Egypt; a peasant whose vineyard was taken away in payment of debts might decide to seek his fortune in the land of fabulous wealth. Perhaps a girl of good family would become pregnant out of wedlock and her parents, unwilling to see her burned at the stake for her sin, would rush her with a trade caravan to Egypt where she might seek employment as a servant and escape death. Jacob had seen many such cases and they strengthened his aristocratic contempt for the country which, in his estimation, stood for vulgarity and social decomposition. </p>
<p>Only Joseph, the dream come true, could drag him to Egypt. And now Joseph was dead. Perhaps if he were to return to Canaan even Joseph, the dream son, might come back to life. At least there Jacob might again taste the sweet anguish of unsatisfied yearning.</p>
<p>Thus Jacob thought. Actually it was all much simpler. Jacob was homesick with that ravaging sense of homesickness which only the very young or the very old can feel. He longed for many things. He wanted the landscape of Canaan; he wanted to be near Rachel's grave; he wanted to be on the scene of his active life and love. Egypt was comfortable, of course, but it provided him only with a desolate sense of physical convenience. There were many things he did not like about Egypt, in addition to the shock of the change in Joseph. And there was the constant memory of Manasseh, which he considered a betrayal. He also disliked what he saw happening to his sons. True, they did not change their names, or their language or their garb. The old man would not have stood for such nonsense. Nevertheless they were changing rapidly. The tempo of the country affected them. The desire for riches seized upon them strongly on the rich pastures of Goshen. Jacob was grieved. His sons scattered. Now and then one or another would come to see the old man and look after his wants, but their flocks multiplied and they did not have much time for such visits. And when they did come, what did they speak of? Sheep and more sheep. Jacob, too, was a shepherd all his life. But how could one compare shepherding in Canaan, or even in Padan, to shepherding in Egypt? There it had been a way of life of the chosen of God. But in Egypt it had become a business. His sons were getting too prosperous; they seldom talked of God, only of sheep and countless loads of hay and more sheep.</p>
<p>And Jacob was greatly afraid. It was the fear that goes with homesickness, the fear of the abandoned child or the deserted old man that no one would come to claim him. In concrete terms it expressed itself in a fear of being buried in Egyptian soil.</p>
<p>It developed gradually, as all really powerful emotions do, gaining in intensity with time. His disapproval of the country and his personal griefs over being betrayed and forgotten—as he thought—he at first expressed in casual statements to his sons: "It will be bad to lie in this Egyptian muck. I would rather we return to Canaan." The sons would raise a questioning eyebrow and usually say nothing to him. The idea of Canaan did not intrigue them. They were prospering in Goshen as they had never prospered before. Canaan's dry hills, aromatic in the spring, had lost their attraction for them. How often did one slaughter a sheep in Canaan? On occasion, yes, but not too frequently. But here, in Egypt, they multiplied rapidly and grew fat on the irrigated fields as Jacob's sons had never seen them before. In Egypt the fleshpots were always full. One did not have to live on a handful of olives a day and taste meat only when celebrating a sheep shearing or some other festive occasion. What more did the old man want in his old age?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AS THE months and years rolled by Jacob's aversion to the country and to the idea of remaining permanently in it grew. Finding no sympathy among most of his sons, he concentrated his complaints on Judah. There was a reason for this. Judah had, in fact, for a long time acted as the head of the family. It was he who undertook the responsibility for Benjamin when the brothers descended to Egypt. It was he who confronted Joseph when Benjamin's integrity was questioned. But he was responsible not only for the youngest but also for the oldest member of the family. To him therefore Jacob increasingly turned for understanding. Nor was he wrong in doing so. In Judah he found a sympathetic spirit. Judah, also, was not too happy in Goshen. Why should he be? He had always had a tormented spirit. Worldly wealth had little appeal for him since it could not calm his troubled soul. He had practically no family of his own. The two sons he had by Tamar were his sons, but he could scarcely feel toward them as a father feels toward his children. They were his sons and grandsons at the same time, begotten in consequence of a fatal sin. They were a constant reminder of his lapse.</p>
<p>Jacob's insistent remarks that he would "rather return to Canaan" therefore found a response in Judah's heart. He, too, was not averse to returning "home," although, being younger, the matter did not weigh so heavily on his mind. On several occasions he reminded Jacob that returning was not such a simple matter. Homesickness and yearning for Canaan were all good and well. There was much to be said for the idea. But the fact remained they were not mere immigrants who could pack up and leave. They had been specially welcomed by Pharaoh. He had even made some of them "rulers over his cattle." There was disadvantage in Pharaoh's favor. One could not get up and leave the country without any more ado under such circumstances. Pharaoh might be displeased. He might even misinterpret the act as a form of disloyalty, or, even worse, desertion. Didn't Judah remember how he and the brothers had been accused of spying for much less than that? And what about Joseph? They certainly had a duty toward him. Joseph was highly placed in the land. That was true. But high rank, like Pharaoh's favor, had disadvantages as well as advantages. Jacob's return to Canaan might reflect on Joseph's loyalty to Egypt.</p>
<p>These arguments Judah presented not at one time but in the course of numerous interviews with Jacob. But as the old man's impetuous insistence on returning to Canaan grew, Judah could not bear to contradict him. The keenness of Jacob's homesickness and his growing disdain for Egypt were outwardly like the tantrums of a heartsick child, but they fed on a store of emotional experiences acquired over more than a century. Judah respected this historical aspect of his father's yearning. He therefore finally suggested that Joseph be consulted, and on Jacob's bidding he went to invite Joseph to visit his father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS visit, like several others that followed it, is not recorded in Genesis. But it must have occurred, otherwise it would be very difficult to account for the mood of a certain passage that will be quoted later.</p>
<p>On the trip to Jacob's dwelling Judah probably conveyed to Joseph an idea of their father's state of mind, and he had an opportunity to think the matter over and prepare his answers. It was just as well for Joseph that he was forewarned, for no sooner had greetings been exchanged than Jacob presented his request. "I want to return to Canaan," he told his son.</p>
<p>"Do you lack anything, father?" Joseph asked him.</p>
<p>"No, my son. I want no earthly convenience. Nevertheless I would return." And as if to strengthen his argument he added: "The famine is past; there is pasture in Canaan."</p>
<p>"It would not be good to part, father," Joseph urged gently. "Haven't we tasted the bitterness of separation for many years? Now we are united about you. Let us not tempt fate."</p>
<p>"You are right, my son, but not entirely right," Jacob replied. "There are differences in parting. There can be tearing apart which leaves an unhealed wound, and there can be departures that are necessary and leave no scar when life is fulfilled. To stay, under such circumstances, would be as hard as departing."</p>
<p>"You would leave me," Joseph began and immediately corrected himself, "you would leave your sons to return to Canaan?"</p>
<p>"Do not say so," Jacob begged him. "It is not I who would be leaving my sons. It is they who are leaving me—have already largely left me. They are forgetting me even while I am here. They are forgetting even as you forgot, not out of an evil heart. This land of Egypt breeds Manassehs."</p>
<p>"Father!" Joseph exclaimed, dismayed. He had known that the name of his first born had injured Jacob's feelings, but he had not dreamed that it tormented the old man to such an extent.</p>
<p>"Do not feel grieved," Jacob tried to soothe him. "I had not meant to question or condemn your choice. I am an old man, my son, and see things that you, younger men, still overlook. There exists, at times, a need for Manassehs—in their proper time proper place. But that is no time and no place for Jacob. I would rather return to Canaan."</p>
<p>"Alone?"</p>
<p>"Not quite alone. Let them stay who do not dread being buried in the mud of Egypt." He was silent for a moment, then resumed his usual refrain which he repeated whenever his longing overcame him: "No, my son, not alone. 'As for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me . . . and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath.' " He peered long and imploring into Joseph's eyes and articulated slowly: "Not alone, my son. Your mother, Rachel, is buried by the wayside of Ephrath."</p>
<p>It was difficult for Joseph to resist this appeal to the memory of his mother. But he was determined to dissuade his father from his mad project.</p>
<p>"No, father, do not speak of burial. You will yet live many years and enjoy the plenty of Egypt." Joseph tried to strike a cheerful note and to guide the conversation into other channels. Jacob said no more.</p>
<p>That was the end of this interview. But as Jacob's homesickness continued to grow and his displeasure with the ways of Egypt mounted, he called upon Joseph again and again. In these later interviews he did say more, although it is a fact that he met with no greater success. At one of these later meetings Jacob's insistence almost led to a rift between father and son. This can only indicate the depth of Jacob's despair in the land of Manassehs, the land of mud, and the intensity of his yearning to return home. This happened when Jacob categorically asked Joseph to send him back to Canaan. The arguments advanced at earlier meetings were gone over again and Jacob remained adamant in his decision. "It is an alien country," he argued, "it is alien to me. In Canaan I lost you only to find you again. Here I found you only to lose you, you and most of the brothers as well. Look at them now. They are becoming like the Egyptians. Are these the children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob? And since I have lost them, I am lost too. I will therefore return to die in the land promised to my fathers."</p>
<p>Joseph was becoming impatient. He had hoped to soothe the old man's spirit and had failed. But how could he let him return to Canaan? It was out of the question. He felt that he had to impress this point on Jacob's mind once and for all.</p>
<p>"It may not be, father," he finally said to him. "If you do not consider your own welfare in your old age, you will certainly heed ours."</p>
<p>"God's blessing has been granted to me several times. He will not abandon me now. I need nothing from Egypt," Jacob declared proudly, completely misunderstanding Joseph's words.</p>
<p>"It may not be," Joseph repeated and explained. "Try to see the situation as it is, father. You have been received by Pharaoh, you have blessed him, the mighty ruler of the two lands whose right hand I am, above everyone else in the kingdom. Can you now, after enjoying the fruits of his bounty, come to him and say: 'I will leave this land because it does not find favor in my eyes and I will return to Canaan?' Or can you say to him: 'The ways of the Egyptians are distasteful to me?' Remember, father, the days of your youth when you worked for Laban, could you even then depart from the land openly and in the sight of men although you had been one of the least in the land and had worked for all you possessed?</p>
<p>"It may not be. For it would be a grave insult to Pharaoh who has dealt well and generously with you and with the brothers and with me. Nor must you overlook my position in the land. What would Pharaoh and all the nobles of Egypt say? They would say: 'The Hebrew Jacob is ungrateful and does not deserve our good will. He is not fit to live in our midst, since he does not value our ways and prefers the savage hillsides of Hebron to the godly blessings of Pharaoh.' Nor is that all they would say. They would also point their finger at me and say: 'Is this the man we admire and obey? His heart, too, must be far away. It is not otherwise than that he, too, is an alien in our midst, perhaps come to mock us.' "</p>
<p>Joseph watched the face of his father, who sat in silence. He believed that now he was at last convincing him and wanted to end the argument permanently. He therefore bent his head low to Jacob's ear and spoke in a half whisper: "Father! We are but Gerim in this land. We have prospered, the brothers and I, in different degrees. But we are Gerim nevertheless. Let us be grateful for what we have and walk humbly. There is no greater virtue for a Ger than humility – each Ger according to his station in life. Our blessing is far off in destiny. Theirs is at hand."</p>
<p>Jacob was silent. Did he understand what Joseph said? It would seem that he understood it perfectly, more perfectly in fact than Joseph had intended. In a flash his inner eye perceived the situation not only the moment but also of the future—the coming slavery, the hard labor, the redemption in the end, but the last was too far off to be a consolation. Because he understood, Jacob said no more. Indeed, he did not raise this subject again until he was on the brink of death, and then his request was more modest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JACOB never asked again to return to Canaan. Joseph's arguments had not deprived him of the yearning to return. But he realized that such a move was out of the question, that in their position of Gerim his departure would cause untold harm to his sons, and especially to Joseph, who was highly placed whose loyalty to Egypt would be questioned. Aware of the impossibility of gratifying his homesickness he became resigned to remaining in Egypt—but not forever. The emotional energy which for­merly lent intensity to his desire to return was now deflected into a related channel. If he must live in Egypt the rest of his days, there was nothing he could do about it. But must he also be buried in Egypt? No, there was no need for this. He would therefore at least return to Canaan after his death and be buried in the cave of Machpelah. He would lie with his fathers, not far from the spot where Rachel lay buried.</p>
<p>He broached this matter to Joseph on some occasions and received rather lukewarm promises. But on this subject he would not compromise. Therefore when he felt that death was imminent, he called upon Joseph again. But this time he did not engage in discussions with his son. At all costs he had to have the promise that his body would be returned to Canaan. For this reason he resorted to a ruse. This was not the first ruse Jacob practiced in his life and he knew how to go about it. He made Joseph swear to something before telling him what it was.</p>
<p>"If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh," Jacob asked his son. This was the traditional form of taking an oath. The gentle, almost ingratiating manner in which this was said dispelled any suspicions Joseph might have had. Besides, Joseph was ready to take almost any oath to please his ailing father whose days were obviously numbered. Once he had taken this step, which bound him to carry out the oath, Jacob said: "Deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt. But I will lie with my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt." Joseph promised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SHORTLY afterward Jacob died. Life for him had become empty indeed. The sole wish left to him could only be fulfilled in death. His body as well as his spirit yearned for this fulfillment and he soon broke down.</p>
<p>But those forces which motivated the drama of Jacob's last years in Egypt did not die within him until Jacob himself was dead. His hatred of the land, his feeling of being betrayed by Joseph's forgetfulness of him, even a certain distrust of Joseph's oath continued strong in his mind till the last minute.</p>
<p>Manasseh. Jacob could not forgive the name even at this stage, seventeen years after his arrival in Egypt, a welcomed immigrant and father, but a Ger nevertheless. And when Joseph brought up his two sons to be blessed by Jacob before his death, the old man, now almost blind, wilfully crossed his hands as he placed them on their heads. How could he bless with his right hand the name that mocked him, the name that put the seal of forgetfulness on the mind of his lost beloved son?</p>
<p>Joseph tried to uncross his hands gently but Jacob was determined. "I know it, my son; I know it. He also shall become a people . . . But truly his younger brother shall be greater."</p>
<p>Would Joseph honor his oath? Jacob had his doubts. What could one expect from a son who had become an Egyptian and had forgotten his father's house? He therefore indirectly reminded him again of his promise. But that did not satisfy him. Joseph was too highly situated and the needs of his position might interfere with his resolution to abide by his oath. After blessing his other sons Jacob therefore appealed to them: "Bury me with my fathers." They, too, were rapidly forgetting. They, too, were becoming Egyptian, in tastes if not in appearance. But they had come with Jacob. They had been in Egypt seventeen years less than Joseph. And their position was humble. Would they disregard the homesickness of their father?</p>
<p>Neither Joseph nor his brothers failed in their promise to Jacob. How Joseph went about the burial, how he told Pharaoh that Jacob had asked to be buried "in the grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan" instead of "with my fathers" is a story apart. For a Ger it was probably necessary to phrase it that way. We were concerned only with the story of the lonely old man who lost his son when he found him and longed to return home but could not.</p>
