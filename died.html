    <h1>The Day He Died</h1>
<p>The moment he opened his eyes early in the morning of that mild, cloudy spring day, Saul knew that this was the day on which he would commit suicide. It was not the kind of knowledge that one encompasses with the mind. It was an all-pervading feeling, as if his body as well as his mind had known the appointed moment for a long time and had become recon­ciled to it. Now that it had come there was neither resentment nor bit­terness, nor gladness either, merely a calm acquiescence in something settled long ago, something necessary and unavoidable.</p>
<p>The thought of suicide had in fact troubled Saul's mind for a long time. As he thought of it many times during the years, he had tried to pinpoint the exact day when the notion had first occurred to him and was incapable of doing so. There were times when it seemed to him that the idea of suicide had been with him since his birth, that it went back to the very edge of his memory and had always been an integral part of his being. Being a reasonable man he naturally rejected this far-fetched notion. He tried to explain to himself why he should want to do such a thing. He listed in his mind his failures and frustrations, yet was never quite con­vinced that they were the true cause of his suicidal plans. He analyzed his states of mind during those times when the idea of suicide pursued him with more than normal insistence and rejected the motives behind them. Either they indicated a desire for self-dramatization, or else they were the product of keen but momentary despairs which he very well knew would pass quickly. Indeed, when he was only twelve years old he had been seized with an impulse to commit suicide as a way of rectifying some wrong done to him. He had then made all the necessary preparations for a dramatic exit from life when suddenly he was overcome with a sharp realization of the fleeting nature of his triumph and that he would soon be forgotten. The impact of this awareness was so strong that he renounced his plans and destroyed all the evidence of his preparations.</p>
<p>In later years, the idea of suicide pursued him insistently like a sense of doom but he always managed to shake it off as soon as he discov­ered some false note in his mood. But it was only postponement—that much he knew. There would come a day when the decision would be fully ripe and beyond postponement, when all the false emotional trappings would fall away and the resolve would emerge clear, unblemished, perhaps not quite a swan song, but like a pure musical note, firm and not to be denied.</p>
<p>Now that this day had arrived he was at peace with himself and properly considerate of the world of mankind which he was about to leave. There was neither self-pity nor triumph in his heart. It was not at all like the days of emotional turmoil such as he had frequently experienced. It was rather like one of the days, of which he had also known many, when he had a certain task to perform, some humdrum, unavoidable, but not too unpleasant assignment.</p>
<p>Since there was nothing more to discuss with himself, no arguments to resolve, no scores to settle, his mind was open to but one thought: there is much to do; I must waste no time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saul got out of bed and rummaged in his dresser-drawer. I'd better put on fresh underwear, it occurred to him. Actually it no longer mattered. By the following morning he would be dead. But this last day was still a part of his life. The act of suicide, too, was a part of the plot of his living, and he even considered the hours following his suicide, the dis­covery of his body, its being taken to the morgue, the autopsy, as the epilogue to his life which still belonged organically to it. His relation­ship with society had not ceased simply because he knew that on this day he would cease living. He still had some duties toward this society which would attend to his remains. He therefore did not wish to offer any possible offense to the attendants at the morgue who would strip his body and to the doctor who would perform the autopsy. There might even be a nurse present. He was not quite sure of the procedure in such cases.</p>
<p>He selected a set of underwear and put it aside. Later would be time enough. There were a number of things to look after. Before lying down for the last time he would take a shower and put on the clean underwear.</p>
<p>It was nine o'clock. Normally he would have been at his desk in the office by this time. The habit of many years asserted itself. Saul felt vaguely uncomfortable for a minute, then he telephoned his office. "Are you ill?" they asked at the office when he said he would not be in on that day. "No," he said, "I am not ill." "Then why aren't you coming to work?" "I can't come today." "Well, in that case. . ." the last words had ominous undertones which were lost on him. Having made the call he felt at peace again, his duty fulfilled.</p>
<p>Though he lived in a large room which had kitchenette facilities Saul decided to take his breakfast outside. This was not according to his cus­tom, but he decided to eat outside on this day so as not to have dishes to wash and food left-overs to dispose of.</p>
<p>He dressed and went into a cafeteria nearby. It was nearly empty.</p>
<p>On the counter lay parts of newspapers left by the customers of the morning rush-hour. He picked up a few stray pages while waiting for his coffee and toast. There were some headlines about a holdup and a rape in Central Park and a statement by the Prime Minister of England. In the center of the front page was a large picture of a four-car crash. Mechanically he read the columns, mildly interested. Then he was struck by the absurdity of what he was doing. Did he wish to report in heaven on what was happening on earth? He put down the paper and impersonally looked out of the window as he ate his breakfast. He mentally listed the things that he had to do that day. Clean the room, dust the furniture and the books, go through his personal papers, letters, snapshots and discard what was not important. In this case it would be nearly everything, but it was necessary to look at the papers before throwing them away. An uninteresting task at this time, but not too odious. Altogether it would keep him occupied till late in the afternoon. There was lunch to take sometime in between. Perhaps a bite after the work was finished, just before. . . . That could be decided when the time came.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saul returned to his room and began with the bookshelf. Methodically he took out the books on the upper two shelves. These were largely pocket-size books and some classics. The lower shelf was covered with a piece of drapery. He wondered whether to dust the books on this shelf too. It might be something of a shock, he thought with a wry smile. But when he finished the first two shelves he automatically removed the cloth and began working on the third shelf.</p>
<p>There were about twenty books on this shelf and all of them were on how to make something. Saul could recall buying each of them, reading it carefully, returning to it now and then over the years. In recent years he no longer, read these books. As he now handled each one separately a shadow crossed his soul, a darkening of vague regret mingled with a trace of superiority and condescension toward himself. Some of the books were old and had been bought many years before. There was one on how to make furniture, another on raising tomatoes in windowboxes. There were books on how to make rowboats, wicker-chairs, book ends, book covers. These were bought when he was still young. He had tried to make many of these things and at one time had spent a considerable part of his salary on supplies and tools. He involuntarily looked about. There were but two things in the room that he had made himself. One was a picture frame which now con­tained a print of a Varga girl, the other was a set of metal book ends he had cast. The latter stood back to back on the table, enclosing nothing, thus emphasizing their unevenness.</p>
<p>The series of "How to Make" books was broken in the center of the shelf by some volumes of a somewhat different order. There was a copy of Higher Mathematics for the Masses. Saul had a vivid recollection of buying this one "I have read it myself and it has done me a lot of good," the salesman had said. Saul remembered reading the first few chapters, and then the subject became too involved and he lacked the will to follow its reason­ing. I guess I am not the type for abstract thinking, he had then con­cluded and never again looked at the book. After this there followed a number of bulky popularizations. There was The Saga of Philosophy, The Tale of Literatures Popular Geography and one or two others. He carefully removed and dusted them, then put them on the floor as if he intended to look at them again. His face had a faint expression of hurt as he handled the Popular Geography and recalled the shock it had given him when he first read it. He had bought it on a bright and sunny day when he felt cheerful. He had glanced through it and liked the childishly brilliant illustrations which seemed to match his mood of the moment. Later that day he began reading it and it produced a most depressing effect. If all of humanity, if said, could be packed solidly into some sort of crate, the container would occupy no more than half a cubic mile and could then be dumped into the ocean without creating very much of a ripple--or words to that effect. It was a very simple statement and he was sure that he and his friends had at one time or another indulged in similar speculations without ill effects. Yet in the book this statement somehow struck him very powerfully. His mood then lost its elation. The brightness of the day seemed to dim. He felt neither warm nor cold, a very strange sensation, as if he did not exist at all. He could not now remember how long this depression had lasted, whether hours or only a few minutes, but it left an indelible mark upon his consciousness and many times after that he was inclined to blame it for recurring states of depression. He did not blame the author of the geog­raphy; he simply dated such dreary moods to the unexpected shock of reading that paragraph, although he never could understand why he had reacted to it as violently as he did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was now almost at the end of the shelf. Only a few more books were left, two medium-sized ones and one small one. The larger ones were Making Friends and Life Begins Anytime. The small one, resting against the side of the shelf was called How to Make Mary. On the fly leaf of the latter was written: "Mary, Mary, quite contrary." Now, why had he written that, Saul wondered.</p>
<p>The telephone rang. Saul listened to the buzz but did not get up to answer it. It was like the summoning buzz in the office whenever the manager wanted to see one of his assistants. He was annoyed with it. Hadn't he called the office in the morning and told them he would not be in? The telephone range for quite a while, then stopped. Saul sank into a reverie. Mary, Mary, quite contrary. Her name wasn't Mary at all. Their names weren't Mary at all, he corrected himself. It was such a smart-alecky little book. He had wanted to throw it away after reading it, not because it taunted him but simply because it was such vulgar trash. And then he had put it on the shelf and forgotten about it. But he could not remember writing that silly inscription.</p>
<p>The thread of his thoughts gave out and he sat contemplating the opposite wall without thinking, or so it seemed to him. Then the telephone buzzed again. He rose and picked up the receiver.</p>
<p>"What a surprise! What a surprise!" a feminine voice pattered over the phone. "You remember me, don't you. I am Levona. Of course you remember me, though it's been such a long time, years, many years, come to think of it, but you must remember me; you must have thought of me because I have thought of you, oh, ever so many times all these years. I am so glad I found you in, and yet not so glad maybe. I am such a compli­cated creature, really. I do want and I don't want, all at the same time, so much so that half the time I don't know what I want and the other half I do know but I don't want it, if you know what I mean. Would you believe me, I do such strange things, like calling you now for instance. First, I couldn't make up my mind whether to call you or not. You know how it is; such a long time, years actually, and then, you remember, I am not quite sure, but it seemed to me that you were angry. But now for some time, oh, weeks actually, I have been thinking about you and thinking that I should call you and I couldn't make up my mind, and then came today and I decided I would call, I can't say just why, but it had to be today; I had a sort of feeling that it had to be today. But like I told you, I am a complicated creature--aren't we all, ha, ha--I knew that I had to call you today and yet I kind of wished you wouldn't be in; I can't say why I felt that way. We all do and say and think such funny and contradictory things. And then all of a sudden I said to myself, I really did: It's a regular week day and the chances are he will be at work, so you see, I would call, and yet I wouldn't, because you wouldn't be at home to answer the phone. And if by chance you should be at home, why, then, I said, then it must be fate, nothing less than sheer outright absolute destiny and nothing else. Would you ever believe that a person is capable of thinking so many strange and contradictory things at the same time? Well, here's a laugh. I called about fifteen minutes ago and really I couldn't make up my mind still whether I wanted to talk to you and I had almost decided that when I heard the receiver being lifted I would hang up, but it kept on ringing and ring­ing and so I was sure that you were away at work and I let it ring. That's the way I am, really complicated, and I do believe I ought to see a psychi­atrist and as a matter of fact quite a number of my friends actually told me that I should see one. And after I knew that you were not in I said to myself, let me try again. Nobody will answer; I know that now. It's really such a strange feeling, and I get it quite often, when I call some­one I am always a little bit afraid that they will answer, because I am never quite positively sure that I really want to talk to them, but when they don't answer why then I go on calling them again and again, because I know there is nobody there, but I imagine what it sounds like, a telephone ringing in an empty apartment, and sometimes I think that the party I am calling is really there but doesn't want to answer, so then it's ever more fun and I am quite sure that if they did lift the receiver I would hang up and say nothing. And now here is a surprise. You are in. I bet you were in when I called before. How are you?"</p>
<p>"I am fine, Mary," Saul said.</p>
<p>"Mary? I am not Mary! I am Levona! You remember me, don't you? Oh my, oh me: Here I went on talking like that, like a real scatterbrain, telling you all sorts of things about myself and you thought it was some­body else all the time. Who's Mary, anyway?"</p>
<p>"Mary, Mary, quite contrary," Saul said.</p>
<p>There was a little gasp of surprise at the other end of the line. "Oh, I'm sorry, I really don't know what you mean. I thought, really I did, that today, well, today somehow was the right day and that I should call you and you would understand, I mean about all these years, and, well, I really sorry and, I hope you are well, and you should give me a ring some­time soon, real soon. Good-by."</p>
<p>"Yes, today," Saul said. "Good-by, Mary."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He heard the click of the receiver and slowly replaced his. It was eleven o'clock and there was still much to do. Would it be better to re­place the books on the shelf first or attend to the other things? He wondered for a moment then he took out his wallet and examined its contents-- twelve dollars, a few old receipts, three faded snapshots taken at a summer resort the year before and a laundry ticket. He tore up the receipts and the snapshots and threw the fragments into the wastepaper basket. Then he went out to claim his laundry. He returned a few minutes later and made his bed.</p>
<p>It might be best, it occurred to him, to empty the dresser-drawers, take out everything and look over what was there, throw away what wasn't needed and then replace all the remaining things. But the idea faded just as quietly as it came and he continued to work slowly and without system. He went to the clothes closet and examined the pockets of his winter coat, raincoat and extra suit. Except for some lint in the pockets of the winter coat they were all empty. Then he straightened out the shirts, underwear and other items of personal apparel in the two upper drawers of the dresser. This took but a few minutes. One shirt he discarded because its collar was frayed. From the bottom drawer he took out a few bundles of letters and papers, two envelopes containing snapshots, also some larger photographs, and dumped them on the bed. He brought over the trashbasket to the bed and proceeded to sort out the papers. Some of them were very old, brown and cracked with age. He was surprised to find among them things he had forgotten about because he had not looked at them for so many years and believed he had disposed of them long ago. There was a diploma among the old papers--a Palmer penmanship diploma which had been awarded to him when he was still in the eighth grade. He had long forgotten about it. Now for the first time during this last day of his life he felt a sentimental twinge as he looked at it. Up and down, up and down, round and round and round and round. . . It had been such a strange moment when it was awarded to him, a moment of mixed pride and achievement and self-consciousness, because as a boy he had felt that it was somehow sissy to receive such a diploma. Up and down, up and down, round and round and round and round. . . There was also a loose-leaf notebook containing some freshman high school compositions of whose existence he had long forgotten: the usual, standard subjects, "How I Spent My Vacation", and "A Visit to the Country," and "What This Picture Means to Me"--the last after the class was taken to an art exhibit. There must have been a literary streak in him, he thought, to have saved these compositions.</p>
<p>He tore up the penmanship diploma and also the composition book. He did not destroy the high school diploma but tore up some yellowing trans­cripts of credits for the one year he attended college. There were some other papers of a semi-official character which he left, then there were three bulky bundles of letters tied with twine. They were all from his mother. Saul had not saved any other letters. Should he throw these away or leave them behind? It didn't matter much one way or another, but he untied the bundles and turned the letters over one by one as if counting them to make sure they were all there. He took out one at random. It had been written a dozen years earlier. "Dear Son," it began. Then followed a few paragraphs of local news about the family and the home town. "I am worried about you," it concluded. "You live alone and you probably don't eat regularly, and what kind of food can one get in restaurants, anyway. Please, please, take good care of yourself. I know that with your talents you will go far and be successful, but don't blame a mother for feeling concerned. I know that what you did was right and that I am old-fashioned. My love and my blessings are with you all the time."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He folded the letter and put it back in its envelope. His mother was already dead. He did not react strongly to the letter and did not reread any of the others. As he recalled, they were nearly all in the same vein. It might be best not to throw them away; let them do with the letters whatever they do with all the rest of the things, he thought without clearly identifying "them." Next to the last bundle there was one more letter, not addressed to him. This one he had found in a park some years before. He had sat on a bench and noticed the folded sheet underneath. Someone evidently had dropped it. He had stared at it for a while and finally picked it up. He opened it and saw that it was a letter. His first reaction was to drop it again. Saul had been brought up to a strict observance of the decencies of life. But the opening line had intrigued him. He noticed the first few words: "Dearest, and what if my life . . . " It sounded corny yet the words had a certain lilt and he read the letter and saved it. Now, years later, it had still not lost its emotional impact. It was a letter from a girl somewhere in the Middle West (the return address was on the bottom) to a young man with whom she was in love. It concluded as follows: "And so I will wait. What else is there for me to do? I was born to wait, for you, even if it is a lifetime. Whenever you are ready, come, I will be waiting."</p>
<p>What corn, he couldn't help thinking. Why did I keep it? His placid mood of resignation gave way for a moment. It might be an idea to write her a letter on this day and to say: "Dear Miss, do not wait any longer, or if you must wait, why then I am sending you under separate cover a book called How to Spend Time Enjoyably. It will help you pass the time more easily."</p>
<p>The minute flicker died down as quickly as it had flared up and he threw the letter into the basket. One more item lay among the old papers-- a large key, a gaudy cardboard affair covered with tinfoil. He had acquired it in a second-rate burlesque theater one dreary winter day. He had felt particularly disconsolate that day and as he walked by the theater the barker's call involuntarily guided him to the ticket window. The burlesque queen on the stage wasn't young any longer; this was evident despite the heavy make-up and the lights. She was draped in a bright red gown split down the center, and as she came mincing onto the stage she sang: "Here is the key to my heart, don't l-o-o-o-se it, u-o-o-se it." She carried a basket of the gleaming tinfoil-covered keys and tossed them to the audience. Saul caught one. After the song she went through a dance of a sort of which the outstanding feature was that she simulated flicking the nipples off her pathetically sagging breasts. This gesture, he remem­bered, brought much applause. He, too, applauded, though he felt very sorry for the woman. But he kept the key. Now he replaced it—together with the old papers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was time for lunch, after one o'clock, and the cafeteria on the corner would not be crowded, but he was not very hungry. He looked at the letters scattered on the bed. There were still the photographs to be gone through. That shouldn't take long. Then tidy up the place, take a shower, and that was all. More than enough time left. "That" had to be done in the evening, after dark, in any case. It would be wrong somehow to do it during the day.</p>
<p>He was about to walk out of the room when the telephone rang again. This time he answered it at once. It was a woman, the wife of an old friend of his. Years before he had been in the habit of visiting them fre­quently. They had a son of whom he had been very fond when he was still a youngster. He used to bring him toys and take him to the zoo and buy him candy. In the envelope containing the photographs there were probably three dozen snapshots of the boy at various stages of his growth. But as the child grew older Saul saw these friends ever more rarely until he stopped visiting them altogether. At first there were some telephone calls and polite inquiries about each other's health, then the contact broke off completely.</p>
<p>"You are such a stranger," the woman said. "One never sees you or hears from you. We scarcely even know what you look like any longer. Isn't it about time we began seeing you again? But what I am calling you about now is that our son, John, he is graduating from high school and we-- and he, too, of course--are very anxious that you should be present at the graduation exercises, and we are giving a little dinner in honor of the occasion, and you must come. John is quite a man already; you can't imagine how he shot up in recent years. He's mechanically-minded. You may have noticed it even when he was still small. And now! His room is a regular factory. Always making things and eager to learn how to make still others. He remembers you well and talks of you often. He has a regular library on how to make this, that and God knows what. He wants to be an engineer--naturally. Maybe, maybe we can get him through engineering college. Will you come to the dinner? And the graduation exercises?"</p>
<p>"Maybe," Saul said.</p>
<p>"You really must come. John will never forgive you if you don't, and as I said it's an occasion."</p>
<p>"I will try."</p>
<p>"You must."</p>
<p>Saul went outside. A light warm drizzle was softly sifting through the air. The cafeteria on the corner was still unexpectedly crowded and he continued down the street. He walked for quite a while, then feeling tired and wet he went into the first restaurant he saw and ordered at ran­dom from the menu. It was pleasant to sit down after the long walk and he felt a comfortable mild cheer coursing through him. Levona should call now, he thought, and she could have fun listening to the unanswered buzz of the phone. And about the dinner invitation--perhaps send something to the boy this afternoon, some books on how to make things? Better forget the whole matter.</p>
<p>He drank two cups of coffee--the second one to celebrate John's graduation, he said to himself, and started back at a leisurely pace. It was after four o'clock when he returned and he became conscious of a sense of urgency. He carefully replaced the books on the shelf and drew the cur­tain over them. He tied the letters from his mother into neat bundles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once more the telephone rang. This time it was his office calling. "The office manager wants to know whether you will come in tomorrow," the voice said. "I don't know," he answered. "Should I say you are ill?" "No, just say I couldn't come today." "But what about tomorrow?" "I can't say." "Should I connect you with the manager?" "No, that isn't necessary." "Then what should I tell him?" "Tell him that I am sorry."</p>
<p>Saul hung up the receiver and went over to the bed. He opened the two bulging envelopes containing the pictures and went through them rapidly. There was quite a number of snapshots of John; the others were mostly vaca­tion and picnic snapshots. There were a few pictures of girls and he was surprised that he could not even recall the names of two of them. The three large photographs were of himself, taken at the time he was graduated from high school. The graduates each had to order at least half a dozen pictures. One of these went to the senior class book, two others he had given away, and the remaining three he had carried along all these years. There was one additional small envelope within which--self-consciously he had wrapped them in three thicknesses of newspaper--were a few pornographic pictures. Saul now glanced at them with a sense of distaste. His distaste was not so much for the pictures themselves as for the recollection of the avidity they once upon a time had aroused within him. They had to be destroyed and he proceeded to tear them into small bits; then he burned these in his large ashtray.</p>
<p>Outside his window he heard many noises. It was after five o'clock and crowds were swarming out of the offices in the neighboring buildings. He looked out of the window for a moment, then surveyed the littered bed. He was nearly through. Everybody was through working for the day. It was time for him also to end his work. He put the papers, the letters and the snapshots back into the bottom drawer of the chest. He straightened out a few odds and ends about the room, then took a cloth and dusted the window­sills.</p>
<p>Now the sense of urgency was gone. He had done all that he had to do and only a few trifles remained to be attended to, but although dusk was beginning to settle early because of the clouds, there was still much time at his disposal.</p>
<p>He took out his key-chain. It was bulky because he always carried an extra set of keys. This was originally intended for safety, in case he lost a key. After he had made a second set of keys to the doors he was confronted with a dilemma. If he left the other set at home, they would be of no help to him should he lose the one he was carrying. On the other hand, if he carried both of them, he might just as easily lose two as one. For a time he kept the two sets on separate chains in different pockets. Then for some reason he bunched all his keys together. It now occurred to him to sort them out and leave them in pairs on the table with a note under each pair telling what they were for. He took out a sheet of paper and cut it into rectangles. He had two keys each for the downstairs door, the door to his apartment, the two suitcases he owned, one set to an apartment he had once lived in and which he forgot to return when he moved out, a single ignition key to a car he had once owned--the other one he gave to the man who bought the car from him--two for the mail box, two to his office and two to the men's room one floor above his office. He sorted them out and neatly placed each set on the identifying rectangle of paper.</p>
<p>For a moment he wondered whether to go out once more for a final lunch but quickly decided against it. He pulled down the window shades, stripped and took a shower. Then he put on his clean underwear, fresh socks, a newly laundered shirt, freshly pressed trousers and his other pair of shoes. The worn articles he tucked into the laundry bag.</p>
<p>As a final gesture, he put a ten-dollar bill near the last set of keys, the ones to the men's room of his office, and on it a note: "A tip for those who will have to handle the body."</p>
<p>All the preparations had been completed. Soon it would be time for "that." A dim thought struggled to reach the surface of his mind but he made no effort to articulate it to himself.</p>
<p>He sat down, calm and relaxed.</p>
