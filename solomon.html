    <h1>Old King Solomon</h1>
    <p class=ital>This is the couch of Solomon, sixty brave men stand about it, of the brave men of Israel, all are girt with swords and trained in warfare for fear of the night.  (Song of Songs)</p>

<p>Old King Solomon pulled the blanket tighter about himself. His feet were cold; his fingers moved stiffly. So soon, he thought. So soon. I am not nearly my father's age and already I am old. The days are bad enough. But the nights. Oh the nights!</p>
<p>In the dimness along the palace walls men armed with shields and swords stirred vaguely. Closer to the king's couch, under numerous torches, a number of royal courtiers sat on carved chairs. They watched his every move and discreetly whispered among themselves.</p>
<p>"I'm cold," Solomon exclaimed aloud. One of the courtiers hurried to his couch. The others rose.</p>
<p>"My lord the king," he said as he bowed low.</p>
<p>"More blankets," Solomon said. "My feet are cold."</p>
<p>He hurried away and whispered orders for more blankets to be brought. Then, summoning the other courtiers with a nod, they all approached the royal couch.</p>
<p>"If your servants have found favor in your eyes," he began, "let us speak, for the well being of the King."</p>
<p>"Speak," Solomon said curtly.</p>
<p>"Let the King bear with us, his servants," he began formally, "but when the King's father, David, grew old his counsellors advised that a fair maiden be found in the broad land of Israel, the fairest of all, and that she lie in the king's bosom to keep him warm. . . . "</p>
<p>"I know," Solomon interrupted the speech. Then his mood changed suddenly and he laughed. "A fair maiden you say? This you say to me? Who has seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines? They are the fairest of this land and of all the lands roundabout. No. The chill that creeps from my toes upward is not the kind which a fair woman can dispel. And the fear which fills me at night--are the armed guards in their places?"</p>
<p>"They are, they are," the counsellors murmured in unison. "All sixty of them . . . stationed along the walls so as not to disturb the king's peace . . . but all of them in their places . . . and armed with swords . . . the mightiest warriors in Israel."</p>
<p>"Good," King Solomon said in a low voice. "Go back to your places." And to himself he whispered, "And still the night is filled with fear."</p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p>A fair woman, Solomon mused. Indeed he had known many of them. Not every one of the one thousand wives and concubines, of course. Most of these were arrangements of convenience, to strengthen relations with neighbor states. But many. And the ones he remembered best were neither wives nor concubines. With one exception--Pharaoh's daughter.</p>
<p>As he thought of her he burst out laughing.</p>
<p>The counsellors stirred when they heard Solomon laughing, but as he did not call them they did not dare approach.</p>
<p>It was well enough to laugh now, but at the time her behavior wasn't funny in the least.</p>
<p>And this is how is all began. Egypt had come on hard times, harder than anyone could remember. In fact, Egypt seemed to be falling apart. And Pharaoh and the lords of Egypt were worried. What if this new upstart in Jerusalem should take it into his head to attack? His father had been a successful warrior and had built up a considerable kingdom. What if the son should continue in his father's ways? Could a torn and weak Egypt resist him successfully? The very thought of it was shameful. Who would have believed that a time would come when mighty Pharaoh would dread the descendants of Egypt's former slaves!</p>
<p>Pharaoh took counsel with his lords and they advised him: Send word to Solomon that you have heard of his father's greatness and that you would have him as a friend, and in token of your friendship offer him your daugh­ter for a wife. He will be so flattered by your offer that any thought he might now harbor about attacking Egypt will be forgotten. This is the way of upstarts who are not used to power and greatness.</p>
<p>This Pharaoh did and his counsellors were proven right. Solomon felt flattered and gladly accepted the arrangement. For a dowry for his daughter, Pharaoh conquered and burned the Canaanite city of Gezer in the foothills of Judea and gave it to Solomon--"to enlarge your kingdom as well as your harem," as he slyly informed the young Judean monarch, hinting that even at its nadir Egypt was still mighty and that his son-in-law should not harbor any idle ambitions.</p>
<p>Then she arrived, the princess of Egypt, borne on a palanquin and accompanied by a host of servants, maids-in-waiting, troops to protect the seemingly endless caravan carrying supplies of all kinds, as if the princess were going to a remote desert oasis instead of to the capital of a young empire.</p>
<p>Solomon received her in his throne room, and the first encounter be­tween them showed that this would be an unsuccessful match and a marriage torn by hostility. Having been seated next to himself on his throne she carefully looked over the chamber and frowned.</p>
<p>No sooner were the preliminary courtesies over than she began dis­dainfully: "In my father's palace . . . "</p>
<p>Solomon interrupted her. "Yes, we know the glories of the Pharaoh. Ours is a young country. Its greatness has only begun. But it will extend down the ages, and if you will become part of it, your name too will go down the ages."</p>
<p>But she did not respond to this overture. The first interview ended coolly and she retired to her chambers and to her maids-in-waiting.</p>
<p>Later meetings were not more happy. Her thin-lipped mouth pursed in derision at everything she was shown. She had asked to be shown the pyramids near Jerusalem and sneered contemptuously when she was told that there were no pyramids in the land of Israel. "Then will you show me your sphinx?" she demanded and scowled when she was informed that there was no sphinx either. "What have you then?" she asked icily.</p>
<p>"We will show you the sacred house of our God Jehovah," she was told. "Very well," she consented in a tone of boredom. "Show me the temple of your God."</p>
<p>The courtiers whom Solomon had appointed to wait on Pharaoh's daughter were peeved by her attitude and pointedly explained to her: "He is the God who took us out of bondage in Egypt and brought us to this land. He caused Pharaoh's chariots to sink in the sea."</p>
<p>But if she understood the intended sarcasm she ignored it.</p>
<p>She was taken to Solomon's temple. She casually glanced at the two pillar-obelisks, Boaz and Yachin, which guarded the entrance and condes­cendingly muttered, "Very nice," but quickly added something about the many pillars that supported the temple of Karnak in Egypt. She was then shown inside and she tried to display some interest, but it was a poor and unsuc­cessful effort at best. When she expressed the wish to look in to the Holy of Holies and was told rather curtly that nobody except the High Priest could enter the chamber, and that, too, only on the Day of Atonement, she yawned and asked to be taken back to the palace.</p>
<p>She made one last request. "Show me your river," she one day ordered her attendants.</p>
<p>Informed that Jerusalem had no river, the corners of her mouth drooped in contempt. "Oh!" was all she said.</p>
<p>And when she was with Solomon later, she flung the accusation in his face:</p>
<p>"You are king in a city without a river."</p>
<p>Matters did not improve with time, and Solomon soon tired of her constant sneers and complaints. At first he ignored her peevish remarks and reminders of the glories of Egypt and of the mighty Nile where she used to sail. Finally there came a day when he suggested that perhaps she would like to be returned to her country and her father's palace.</p>
<p>Indignation and terror seized her at this suggestion. What? She, a daughter of Pharaoh, to be sent away like some discarded concubine? The shame and the humiliation of it overwhelmed her.</p>
<p>But she also realized that Solomon had the power to do so and she remembered that her father was not in the best position to teach a lesson to this upstart king in a city without a river, and she whispered, "I will stay."</p>
<p>It was then that Solomon ordered his servants to build for her a separate palace and to fill it with miniatures of sphinxes, pyramids, cats, hawks and the rest of Egyptian paraphernalia, and never saw her again.</p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p>Then there was the Queen of Sheba. She had come with her caravans laden with all kinds of rare spices, gold, silver, and other gifts. She had heard of Solomon's wisdom, she said, and it was this that brought her there.</p>
<p>Solomon did not at once summon her to court. Sheba? Where was this land of Sheba, he asked his counsellors.</p>
<p>They did not know exactly. But they had heard from the captains of Solomon's ships that it lay somewhere far to the south. Some said it was on the right side of the sea, others said it was on the left. Their ships had been blown about so, they did not know exactly where they were when they sighted land. But it was definitely far to the south, and it was ruled by a queen. Had any of them seen that queen, the captains were asked. No, they had not. They had not gone inland and the queen's abode was far from the shore. What then could they tell about the land of Sheba? Not much, it turned out, except that its people were dark-skinned and friendly.</p>
<p>Oh well, Solomon thought. I will have to ask her to the palace. Visiting queens have their rights, as a matter of protocol--even if nobody knows just where the land of Sheba is. So he sent messengers to invite the queen to appear before him, not on that day, nor on the day after, but on the third day. There was no hurry. It was all a routine matter of pre­scribed formality.</p>
<p>But when on the third day the queen of Sheba came and approached his throne, bearing some immense jewels, he looked at her once and time seemed to come to a halt. What was it about her that produced this effect on him, he wondered in later years. She was beautiful, it was true, but he was no longer a young man during her visit, and there were many famous beauties in his harem. No, female beauty alone could not by itself have caused time to stop for him in her presence. She was swarthy, almost black, and the mass of her black hair rose over her head like a dark cloud not like the orderly loose falling black tresses of so many of the beauties in his harem which made one think of goats whose hair had been combed by the brambles among which they browsed. It was her eyes that riveted his gaze to her face. It was they that caused him to gasp, Oh, and to stop the flow of-time. For an instant a great terror swept over him. It wasn't a woman that was standing before him, nor even a queen, it was a dark burning bush, a black flame, glowing and flickering and throwing off sparks, threatening yet promising when she smiled. He was stricken speechless. He was about to descend from his throne and kneel before her, when she smilingly began her formal little speech: "The fame of your great wisdom has reached me in faraway Sheba . . ." To him it sounded like a proclamation of love, and he mut­tered incoherently: lo yodati nafshi, "I don't know what has come over me."</p>
<p>But she knew, and so did he, and like torrents words, often inco­herent, gushed from them, insistent, urgent, tumbling cascades of words that could not be contained. They would stop for a moment, amazed at this volcanic outburst, only to yield to it again, even as they were aware that both were saying the same thing. Yes. Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>Forgotten were the dignified courtiers who stood about them exchang­ing reticent but meaningful glances, and King Solomon descended from his throne and the Queen of Sheba moved to meet him halfway and they held each other's hands and what they said was, Oh yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Gone was the throne room, gone the palace.</p>
<p>"Let us pretend," she said much later, "let us pretend that you are a king and I am a queen."</p>
<p>"But we are king and queen," he laughed.</p>
<p>"Of course we are," she said. "But let us pretend that we are a real king and queen, you understand what I mean."</p>
<p>"Once there was a king," she teased.</p>
<p>"And the king had a queen," he countered.</p>
<p>"The queen--she had a vineyard."</p>
<p>"A locked vineyard is my sister, my bride. A locked vineyard, a sealed spring."</p>
<p>They became lovers. They made love and tears of ecstasy flowed from their eyes. They made love laughing gaily like children frolicking. They made love gravely as if performing a solemn ritual. They made love calmly, and they were at peace.</p>
<p>"And what," she asked uncounted days later, "and what if I should have a son? What should I name him?"</p>
<p>Solomon thought a moment. "Name him Mimeni Loch; it means a gift from me to you."</p>
<p>"You don't know the accents of my people," she laughed. "They will most probably twist it to sound something like menelik."</p>
<p>"Very well," Solomon agreed. "Then let him be called Menelik­ - Menelik the First." And after a pause he added: "The conquering lion of Judah."</p>
<p>And as the time of her departure neared, he asked her, "Will you come to Jerusalem again?"</p>
<p>She shook her head sadly. "No. One comes to Jerusalem but once."</p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p>Solomon stirred uncomfortably on his couch and beckoned to the courtiers. They hastened to him.</p>
<p>"Sheba," he whispered. "Has there been any word from the Land of Sheba?"</p>
<p>"No," they murmured. "It has been a long time since any of your ships have been to Sheba."</p>
<p>"And the queen, the daughter of Pharaoh, how is she fairing?"</p>
<p>"She seldom leaves her abode. She has caused a brook to be made to flow through her palace and has placed small pyramids along its sides. She sits at the side of the brook and gazes at it for hours."</p>
<p>"She still yearns for her native land then?"</p>
<p>"No. Not any longer. Not since her father died and the new Pharaoh ascended the throne of Egypt. His name is Sheshonk."</p>
<p>"I know," Solomon nodded. "And he is plotting against me, I've heard?"</p>
<p>"The Lord will preserve you from all your enemies even as he pre­served your father David. But Pharaoh is plotting and has befriended our lord the King's enemy, Jeroboam, and has even given him his wife's sister for a wife."</p>
<p>"And Shulamith?" the king whispered. "Is she well?"</p>
<p>A faint smile flitted across the faces of his courtiers. So the old king had not forgotten the follies of his youth, they thought. "She is well and is a mother in Israel many times over," they assured him . . .</p>
<p>Solomon sank into thought. It was all so remote. He was still in his teens, a young king surveying his kingdom when he met her in the far north, in a village in the foothills of Lebanon. And he lost his head over her and brought her to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>How the harem buzzed with gossip and snickers and jeers over the event.</p>
<p>"So the king has a new favorite, eh? What did you say her name was?"</p>
<p>"I didn't say, but her name is Shulamith."</p>
<p>"Shulamith! A princess or something?"</p>
<p>"A princess my eye. You know what she was doing at home?"</p>
<p>"How would I know? But tell me anyway."</p>
<p>"Well, they say she was guarding vineyards for the people in her village."</p>
<p>"Guarding vineyards! What kind of work is that for a girl from a good family! And they say she isn't more than fourteen years old, maybe only thirteen. What could a child like her do if thieves came?"</p>
<p>"Silly! It wasn't thieves she was guarding against."</p>
<p>"All right, smarty, when then was she guarding vineyards against if it wasn't thieves?"</p>
<p>"She was guarding them against foxes, little foxes that destroy vineyards."</p>
<p>"Well, how would I know? In my father's house this kind of work was left for the stupidest servants. And, say, how come you know so much about vineyards and foxes?"</p>
<p>"What are you insinuating, you poor trash? I'll have you know I am the daughter of a king."</p>
<p>"I know, dearie, I know. But would you do me a great favor and re­mind me the name of the land your father is king of? I just can't seem to remember it somehow, no matter how hard I try."</p>
<p>"Oh, you make me tired."</p>
<p>While in another part of the harem the talk was even more envenomed. "And you know what Solomon told this Shulamith? He said he wants to take her to Jerusalem to show her to his mother."</p>
<p>"Kid stuff, just a couple of youngsters playing."</p>
<p>"Kid stuff my foot. With a mama like that he'd better introduce his new girl friend to her."</p>
<p>"He is shrewd all right. Just like his mother."</p>
<p>"The witch."</p>
<p>"And you know something else? You know what the king is doing all day now? He is composing love songs for this Shulamith."</p>
<p>"How come you know so much?"</p>
<p>"I just know. I have my sources of information. And you should hear some of the things he writes. You'd die laughing."</p>
<p>"Like for instance?"</p>
<p>"He says she looks beautiful in shoes. Can you imagine?"</p>
<p>"Poor thing. I'll bet it's her first pair of shoes ever."</p>
<p>"She must be uncomfortable in them."</p>
<p>"And he says that her head is beautiful as Mt. Carmel."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know about her head, but Mt. Carmel is beautiful. I saw it once."</p>
<p>"And I heard that she is flat-chested." another concubine chimed in. "Where did you get that information?"</p>
<p>"Well, her own brothers have said so. That's what I heard. When Solomon asked to take her away to Jerusalem, they complained that she was too young, 'We have a little sister,' they said, 'but she still has no breasts.' But you know what Solomon writes in his songs about her? 'Her breasts are like twin fawns of a gazelle.' he wrote. The fool!"</p>
<p>"No use getting jealous, dearie."</p>
<p>"Well, he is a king, after all. A king can say anything he likes."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus the harem buzzed, but not for long. For Shulamith pined for her faraway village and eventually Solomon sent her home.</p>
<p>What if he were to have her summoned now? Could she at least restore the faintly remembered image of desire?</p>
<p>Of course not. He would no doubt find a wrinkled aging woman worn by much toil and many childbirths. Better than a wilting painted and per­fumed queen, to be sure, but no consolation for his fears and for the chill that nightly creeps from his toes ever higher. One day, and that not too far off, it will reach his heart and then . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Old, old, old, and the kingdom is breaking up. Not so that one could see it easily, for on the surface all seems well enough still. During the day he still sits on the throne and the embassies continue coming from far and away. "We bring gifts for the wisest of all men," they say and bow low.</p>
<p>But other messengers come as well, without fanfare, and discreetly inform in subdued tones: Aram refuses to pay its tribute; Jeroboam sits on the Nile and bides his time. "Would that our lord the King were to lead his hosts against these rebels."</p>
<p>Strange. He, Solomon, the son of a conquering father, had never led an army into the field. And now it is too late to do so. Far too late. He must pretend that all is well, and perhaps it will continue so for a while, for if he were to proclaim an alarm, all might collapse at once. Pretend, pretend, pretend, he keeps saying to himself. Delude the people that all is well. But how delude himself? And if one could delude oneself in the tumult of the day's events, how extend the delusion into the night?</p>
<p>Oh that he, the wisest of all men should have let things come to this pass. But then, what is wisdom? A heap of vanity. "The wisdom of the poor is held in contempt," he had said. But let a man sit on a throne, and every­thing he says becomes greatest wisdom. How did it all start--his reputation for wisdom? Oh, yes, that business with the infant which each of two women claimed for her own. His order: Cut the child in half, had been meant by him as a joke, and looking at it backward, it was a joke in poor taste, a gruesome, cruel joke which only a raw young man would think of. But how the fools gloated! Wonderful: Wonderful: God endowed our young king with great wisdom! And after that no matter what he said and did was held to be the highest wisdom. Even if he said one thing one day and its exact oppo­site the next. He had tried this too, as a joke, and it had worked. One day he proclaimed sententiously, "Thou shalt not answer a fool according to his foolishness," and they all Oh'ed and Ah'ed admiringly. How true: How true: Why allow oneself to become involved in an argument with a fool? The next day he proclaimed from the throne: "Answer a fool according to his foolishness." and the idiots again exulted at the profundity of his remark. Of course! Of course, they exclaimed. If someone tells you something stupid, pay him back in his own coin. How true! How true! It is remarkable that such an obvious truth never occurred to anyone else. Asmodeus took on the guise of Solomon and sat on the throne for ever so long, and the imbeciles couldn't tell the difference, until he played that famous trick, and had them scatter ashes on the floor of the royal bed chamber and only then did they see that the footprints were those of a cloven-hooved devil.</p>
<p>So soon, so soon--only two generations of royalty and already dec­adence has set in. From his father David he had inherited the gift of poetry, from his mother the gift of shrewdness. And now these gifts have already run out and his son and heir . . . Rehavam</p>
<p>A princeling, Solomon thinks contemptuously. All he knows are his pleasures, and jollity, and larking with his young friends. Is he fit to carry on the dynasty, to rule this people?</p>
<p>He comes when summoned, all perfumed and dressed in fancy linen garments, his hair tied in a knot at the back of his neck, his beard modishly trimmed to a point.</p>
<p>"My son," Solomon says to him, "have you thought of your duties as the future ruler of this great land?"</p>
<p>Rehavam makes a courtly bow. "May my Lord the King live forever."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," Solomon says impatiently, "but no one lives forever." Rehavam bows a second time. "The Lord of Sabaot has blessed the throne of David forever and ever."</p>
<p>Solomon dismisses him with a wave of the hand. Decadent. Decadent so early in the dynasty. He does not even dream of assassinating his father; he is not even eager to become king. And his numerous brothers and half-brothers are no better--pampered princelings.</p>
<p>Was it perhaps a mistake--that his mother had obtained the throne for him while he was still a boy? Was his entire life a mistake perhaps? Who else could have sat on it to greater advantage? Well, there had been Absalom his half-brother. That was long ago, before Solomon was born. Absalom! Now there was a royal figure! He had been famed for his beauty, like his sister Tamar. No poetry or proverbs or sage wisdom for him. And the people loved him, for his beauty, for his regal bearing, and were willing to follow him even against David. Had it not been for a ruse, he, Absalom, would have been king. It would have been better thus: a handsome and brave king. Poets, sages--they are the elect, but they should not be the anointed. What does he, Solomon, have to show at the end of his long reign? Three books: a scroll of love poems, and one of proverbs, and one of tired wisdom. Are these the legacy of a king? Do they sum up a reign?</p>
<p>But of course, things had happened as they did, Absalom was killed in battle. And, in any case, his reign could have led to nothing for he was childless.</p>
<p>Perhaps the fault is at the root of the matter, with the House of David?</p>
<p>There was Saul. A driven, melancholy king, head and shoulders above all others, bearing down in his very bones. He was prepared to sacrifice his own noble son to keep his vow but went against the will of God himself to spare his vanquished enemy. He did not run to God for mercy every so often, nor dance in the streets with glee at every triumph. He bore his kingship alone, knowing that kings must be alone. No bright witticisms, no modish weary declarations that all is vanity, vanity of vanities, from him. Nor even rebellion against fate. A doomed king. For if all men are doomed, should not a king be doubly doomed? And in the end he fell upon his sword, as all true kings must. Had it not been better had Saul's house prevailed?</p>
<p>He noticed a stirring along the walls and chamber doors and beckoned to the courtiers.</p>
<p>"What is the commotion?"</p>
<p>"The morning star has risen and the guard is being changed," they informed him. "Soon the morning sacrifice will be offered."</p>
<p>They clustered about him respectfully, waiting for him to speak. But as he remained silent, the chief among the courtiers addressed himself to Solomon: "Will not the King speak to his servants words of wisdom at the beginning of this new day?"</p>
<p>Solomon glanced at them casually, then his gaze become intently fixed, looking into the recesses of time where other men spoke other idioms. He held out his outspread hands in a gesture of despair and resignation, but all he said was:</p>
<p>"Nu."</p>
