    <h1>The Leaning Tower of Pisa</h1>
<p>"It says here in the paper," the man said as he made himself more comfortable in the old upholstered chair. "It says here . . ."</p>
<p>It was late Sunday morning, almost noon and the man and his wife were in the living room of their shabby apartment, he in his soft chair, she alongside an ironing board, a heap of fresh laundry beside her.</p>
<p>"It says here," the, man repeated, "that The Leaning Tower of Pisa is leaning more than ever. They are worried about . . Afraid it'll topple over."</p>
<p>"Is that what's worrying you?" the woman said, ironing energetically, angrily.</p>
<p>"It should worry you too," the man said putting the paper on his knees. "Do you understand what this means? The Leaning Tower of Pisa--one of mankind's greatest . . . one of the wonders of the world."</p>
<p>"You don't say! What will you do tomorrow?" the woman asked disre­garding his comment on the Tower of Pisa.</p>
<p>"What will I do?" he echoed her. "What can I do?"</p>
<p>"You can go down to the union, can't you. You can talk to the busi­ness agent."</p>
<p>"I did; I saw him the other day, Friday."</p>
<p>"You got to be after him, every day. They can't do this to you. You've been a dues paying member for twenty years, and you've been laid off now for more than eight weeks. They got to find you something."</p>
<p>The man stared at her blankly a moment then again picked up the paper. "It's leaning another three inches from center," he declared. "Another three inches since they last took measurements. If it keeps up at this rate, it says here, the tower will fall in about eight years."</p>
<p>"Is that so," the woman said beginning to show a slight interest in the subject. "How long has it been that way? How long has it been leaning, I mean?"</p>
<p>"Why practically from the start, that's what it says here." "And when was that?"</p>
<p>"A long time ago, hundreds of years ago. Let me see, it tells right here. They finished it in 1350 and it began to tilt even before they fin­ished it. At first they thought it might collapse at once, then it settled down. But lately it's begun to lean again, and they are worried."</p>
<p>"Oh well," the woman brushed the matter aside. "If it's been that way all this time it'll stay that way."</p>
<p>"You don't understand," the man said in an irritated tone. "It's like a person, see? He carries on and on, but when he starts slipping, look out, or it'll be too late. Now it says here the engineers are work­ing on it. They plan to pump concrete under the base of the tower. They hope this will hold it up, stop it from leaning any farther."</p>
<p>He looked toward the woman is if expecting some comment from her. When she said nothing he resumed and now there was a faint tone of enthu­siasm in his voice and even his eyes lit up somewhat. "It would be terrible it if collapsed. It's one of the greatest achievements of civilization. Do you realize what it means?"</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Let's see now, he thought. They are going about it the wrong way, that's for sure. Pumping concrete under the sagging side won't work. Any fool would know this much--any apprentice bricklayer. If the tower sags on one side it means the ground on that side is soft. You pump in concrete and it too will sink deeper into the soft ground. That's no solution. The thing to do now, let's see, the thing to do is to take some of the weight off from the sagging side. That's easy. Dig under the opposite side, let that side of the tower settle--it will take the pressure off from the lean­ing side. It might even straighten the tower. But that won't do either. The tower has to lean some or it wouldn't be the wonder it is. So it might be best to do some of both--shore it up a bit on the leaning side by pump­ing concrete underground and lower it a bit on the other side. Then the sag will be stabilized, for a long time, could be forever.</p>
<p>He signed with a sense of relief.</p>
<p>"Did you say something?" the woman asked.</p>
<p>"No. I didn't say a thing. But I think I got it figured out." "You got what figured out?"</p>
<p>"The Leaning Tower of Pisa, how to stabilize it."</p>
<p>"You still got that on your mind?"</p>
<p>"Woman, you don't understand."</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door and a woman from a neighboring apart­ment came in. She was invited to sit down and chatted briefly about incon­sequential matters.</p>
<p>Is your man back on the job?" she asked, politely ignoring her host and addressing herself to her hostess.</p>
<p>"No," the answer came short and curt.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to hear that," the visitor said apologetically, sensing she had made a mistake in asking. "Things are tough all around. But you shouldn't complain. You have your man and you have a fine daughter and everything will turn out all right. Look at me. Four years now since my man was killed in that accident."</p>
<p>"Yeh," the woman exclaimed in a sneering tone. "Yeh, I have my man." She upended the iron on the board and held out her hand crooking her index finger contemptuously.</p>
<p>The visitor was embarrassed and only repeated, "You shouldn't com­plain. I am sure everything will turn out all right. He is bound to be called back to his job soon. Real soon," she added.</p>
<p>The woman resumed ironing vigorously. "He is busy all right," she hissed venomously.</p>
<p>"Oh," the visitor remarked sensing the anger in her hostess' voice and afraid to commit herself any more definitely.</p>
<p>"Yeh, he is busy! You know with what? You know what's worrying him?"</p>
<p>"What?" the visitor asked timidly, afraid of touching on some other family bitterness.</p>
<p>"He is worried that The Leaning Tower of Pisa might collapse. That seems to be the main thing troubling him now,"</p>
<p>"The what?"</p>
<p>"The Leaning Tower of Pisa. There's a building like that, in Italy someplace, an old building, and the paper says it's sagging bad—that's what is worrying him."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know," the visitor remarked, glad that the conversation was now on a safe track. "I know. I saw a picture post card of it once. It's a very famous building, and really funny the way it tilts. Looks like it won't stand up another minute, but people keep climbing all the way up to the top all the time. The card showed them, way up near the top."</p>
<p>"A famous building!" the man interjected ironically. "It's one of the greatest monuments of our civilization! Like, like . . ." and for a moment he couldn't think of an equivalent--"like the Washington Monument"; then he added triumphantly, "like the Cathedral of Notre Dame. If this tower were to fall, why, why, what would this world be? You tell me."</p>
<p>"Yes," the visitor sighed sympathetically. "So many things seem to go to pieces nowadays. Sometimes one can't help feeling that everything is coming apart, about to collapse."</p>
<p>"If it falls, it falls," the woman ruled with finality. "They'll clear the site and maybe make a parking lot, or put up an apartment build­ing. And speaking of things coming apart," she addressed her husband, "you could fix that leaking faucet in the kitchen. You've been promising for the past week."</p>
<p>The visitor turned to her hostess. "You know what I came for? I'd like to borrow some pieces from your tea set. He is coming to visit this evening," she added meaningfully.</p>
<p>"Of course, of course," the woman said. "I understand." She quickly went to the kitchen and soon returned with cups, saucers and sugar bowl. "Well, here is good luck. I hope everything turns out as you wish it for yourself."</p>
<p>"You understand," the neighbor said as she slowly walked to the door carrying the dainty dishes. "A man about the house, someone to lean on. You shouldn't complain. You have a good man."</p>
<p>"Yes," the woman muttered. "A man about the house. A tower of sup­port. Maybe a leaning tower," she added bitterly. "Well, good luck, good luck."</p>
<p>The door clicked shut behind the visitor.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The woman resumed ironing. Her husband returned from the kitchen and again picked up his paper. For a while both were silent.</p>
<p>The woman broke the silence. "You should talk to Laura," she said. "You are her father. You should talk to her."</p>
<p>The man wearily put down his paper.</p>
<p>"Laura?" he asked. "What about Laura?"</p>
<p>"If you would take an interest in your daughter, you wouldn't ask 'What about Laura?'" She was silent a moment, then added, "Last night, she didn't get back till around three."</p>
<p>"Oh, she did. Well, I wouldn't worry too much. A young girl. Seven­teen. And our Laura is a pretty girl. She is popular; she has lots of friends. We didn't get back home early when we were her age."</p>
<p>"It's not only the hour I'm talking about," the woman said ironing briskly.</p>
<p>"What then?"</p>
<p>"The way she looked."</p>
<p>"You mean liquor? Drunk?"</p>
<p>"No, not that."</p>
<p>"Then what?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I am not sure. I suspect drugs."</p>
<p>The man slumped deeper into his chair. "No," he said. "That can't be. Our Laura is a good girl."</p>
<p>"Sure. They are all good boys and girls. But it's the fashion now. And Laura is young and impressionable."</p>
<p>"Did you talk to her about it this morning? Did you ask her?" "Did you?" she countered. "You didn't even stir when she came in around three in the morning."</p>
<p>The man fidgeted guiltily in his chair. "I can't believe it," he muttered. "It's only her age. Youngsters will have fun. We did when we were young."</p>
<p>"Yeh," the woman sneered. "A generation thing. And when we find out it isn't, it will be too late. You should talk to her. You are her father. Instead of worrying your head about some leaning tower ten thousand miles away," she concluded sarcastically.</p>
<p>The man slowly rose from his chair and silently walked to the window. A bleak wintry street stretched before him. Grimy four- and five-story buildings extended into the distance until they were lost in the cold fog. A few people, walked disconsolately outside.</p>
<p>Yes, he thought, things are coming apart, going to pieces, leaning, about to fall. A little concrete pumped into the foundations won't help. The Leaning Tower of Pisa. One of the wonders of our world. But they don't understand. They refuse to understand. If it were to fall, nothing would ever be the same again.</p>
<p>He turned away from the window.</p>
<p>"Never."</p>
