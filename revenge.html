    <h1>Revenge</h1><p>They are the finest people. They don't come any finer, I can tell you. I ought to know. I've been working for them for near twenty years now. It's a long time, a mighty long time. But they've been good to me—from the very start they've been good to me and there isn't a thing I wouldn't do for them, or they for me, I'm sure. It isn't as if they treated me like a servant at all, like most white folks do. I am like one of the family almost, you might say. From the very start, practically. There isn't a thing about that family I don't know; I can tell you that. I know more about them than about my own family.</p>
<p>I recall the first time I reported to work for them. My man was in the army at the time; the war was on. And there I was with two small children; Ellie, she was six years old, and Richard Jr., was three, and the allotment I got from the army didn't anywhere near make ends meet, so I went to work. I worked for some dogssat first, I can tell you that. No respect for a person at all. All day it's, "May, do this," and, "May, do that," and, "May, the kitchen shelves aren't done right." and, "May, there's dust in the corner near the refrigerator." And for lunch, if they give you a sandwich and a cup of coffee they feel so goddam generous they expect you to put in some overtime at the end of the day. And more than likely at the end of a week, or two at most, they tell you, "We won't need your services any more." Got somebody for fifty cents a day cheaper on the slave market, more than likely. And the kids, I mean my kids, if I ever brought one of them around to the house, the looks I'd get, and the warnings they'd give me. "Now, May, please keep the child out of the dining room, we're having company tonight and I don't want things messed up." Or, "May, please be careful your boy doesn't leave fingerprints all over the walls,"--be careful this and don't let him do that, and see that he stays out of here--all the time. And there were lots of times when I had to take my little Richard along for he was too young to leave alone at home, and Ellie, she was going to school, and I did have him signed up in the Neighborhood House for nursery but many times he just wouldn't stay there. So when the Agency sent me to this place, to the Hirschs, I said to myself, there's another one that will last maybe a week or two--the same old trouble, and there aren't any white folks that are good to work for, and maybe there aren't any folks that are good to work for; but what dif­ference does that make, we never work for any but white folks. But I was wrong this time. I couldn't be wronger.</p>
<p>I recall the first time I reported to work for the Hirschs. They lived on Riverside Drive then, near Ninety-Third Street, and it was a miser­able day, February it was and snowing a bit and sleeting a bit and the wind it just went through you. I walked in the lobby and the doorman he showed me to the freight elevator the servants used, and I didn't mind that at all, I can tell you; that's the way it was in all the buildings I worked in and I was just plain glad to get out of the wind which cuts like razors on Riverside Drive. And when I rang the bell and Mrs. Hirsch opened the door for me and I gave her my referral slip from the Agency, it was plain from the very first minute that here was a different kind of home and these were a different kind of people. She took the slip and read it, and "Mrs. Clay­more," she says, "come right in, this way." Mrs. Claymore is my name, but you know, I'd worked in maybe fifteen different homes the year before that and I don't believe more than one or two ever called me that. From the first minute it would be May. Then, May, do this, and May, do that. Not that I minded it much--why should I; that's the way things are and that's the way I suppose they ought to be. But just the same, a body sometimes wants to be shown a little courtesy above her station. And here it was from the first minute, "Mrs. Claymore, I am Helen Hirsch," and, "Won't you come this way?" and, "You poor thing, you're frozen through and through." And, would you believe it, I took my coat off and she led me to the kitchen and made me sit down and she poured me some hot coffee and she waited on me as if she was working for me and not the other way around, until I warmed up.</p>
<p>It was a fine family to work for. There was Mr. and Mrs. Hirsch and they had three children. Mr. Hirsch I didn't see much. He was in some kind of business, insurance I guess, and he was hardly ever at home and out of town a good deal. And Mrs. Hirsch, she was the kindest and nicest woman to work for all along. Never an angry word, and mostly it was, please do this, and, won't you please do that or the other thing while I am gone. For she was a busy woman what with all kinds of clubs and committees and women's groups she belonged to, and after a while of course she just called me May, but to show you the kind of people they were, she insisted that I call her Helen, instead of Mrs. Hirsch. At times she used to have little parties for her women's clubs at home, and then she'd introduce me to the women when they came. "I want you to meet Mrs. Claymore," just like I was a member or something.</p>
<p>Work? Sure there was work, and sometimes plenty of it. They had three children, the Hirschs did. The two boys were the older. David was fifteen when I started working there, and Monroe was thirteen. Nice boys, bright and well-behaved, and courteous to me too. They'd been brought up right and taught properly. When once David, the older one, wanted some­thing done in his room and said to me, "May, do this right away," whatever it was, Mrs. Hirsch told him off and no mistake about it. "Young man, you apologize at once. Mrs. Claymore is not just May to you at any time, and you might as well remember while we are about it that you always say please when you ask her to do something," He did, too. He apologized very nicely, and as punishment, his mother made him do the chore he asked me to do. He hadn't meant any harm to begin with. Just a scatterbrained kid who had forgotten his manners a minute. But that's the kind of home it was and that's the kind of family they were.</p>
<p>Then there was Sandra. Sandy, everybody called her. She was six, just like my Ella. A beautiful baby and everybody's pet and just a little bit spoiled maybe, but who could help spoiling her. The boys took after their mother and were fair haired and blue-eyed—didn't look Jewish at all. Sandy took after her father. Her hair was jet black and so curly it was almost a little kinky, and it was unruly. There was no combing it and no holding it down, but it was like a black halo over her head and sometimes I did think she looked a little like an Ethiopian princess. Eyes? You never saw anything like it in your life. Black, or rather dark brown, of course. But it wasn't the color, it was how they lit up whenever she was excited or gay or even when she was grieving. And it was one or the other all the time. That girl was hardly ever calm inside. When she was grieved over something there was that much sorrow in her eyes it made you cry; and when she was excited about something, which was mostly the case, her eyes danced so your feet could hardly stand still. And if she looked at you dreamy kind of, thinking of something, they were deep like a summer night. She had the deep eyes of a princess, and she sure knew it and lorded it over everybody, but in a nice way. And she was giggly, too, when she was small, and mischievous in a way.</p>
<p>She took to me from the very start, and I to her; I couldn't help it. Nobody could, if she picked them. And here was this family, the father at home only evenings and not always then either. Mrs. Hirsch was busy a lot of the time with her women's clubs and committees. The boys of course used to tease Sandy a bit, but never really paid much attention to her, as boys will to a sister who is a lot younger than they. So she became my baby almost from the start. At times I used to wonder could it be blood calling to blood? She sometimes did look as if she had a touch of color in her. But I don't put much store in such notions. It's people that count, I say. There's good people, and then there is the other kind, and I don't care if they are colored or white. Thought, for that matter, so far as this family went, I also thought now and then that maybe their being Jewish had some­thing to do with it, what with the Bible and the Holy Land and the Jordan and all that. But I really don't know and don't care much. Give me a good person and I don't care what his color or religion is.</p>
<p>Around that time, about a year after I came to work at the Hirschs, things took a bad turn for me personally and never quite turned right side up again. First my man came back from the service, and that was good.</p>
<p>We'd been married for seven years and got along fine. I loved him and he loved me. Well, when he was discharged from the service and came home, I took a week off from the Hirschs and we said we'd have ourselves another honeymoon what with his coming home and it being seven years since our first honeymoon. Honeymoons have to be repeated at regular intervals, I say, if a marriage isn't to go stale on a couple. So we did. We did a lot of loving that week and a lot of drinking and visiting and just getting around. All in all we had ourselves a ball and no two ways about it, it seemed.</p>
<p>But then I began to notice that things weren't quite as they used to be before my man went into the service. He just wasn't the same man. He drank hard. He was sullen. And didn't seem to give a damn about anything — not even about me and the children, it seemed. In the army he had served in a labor battalion--a colored labor battalion--under white officers. He wrote me about that when he was still in the service. I thought maybe some­thing that happened to him in the service changed him. But he wouldn't talk. He was gruff with me and with Ella and didn't pay any attention hardly to the boy. Some weeks passed and he didn't even try to get a job. At first he collected some kind of vet's unemployment insurance, and later he was just unemployed. Hung around the neighborhood bars till closing time, slept till every hour of the day, got up cross with the children, and with me when I returned from the Hirschs. He used to be a good mechanic before he went into the service--could turn his hand to almost anything, auto mechanic, plumber, electrician, anything. Always had work. Now he didn't care. He'd pick up a day's work now and then. He was offered steady jobs and turned them down. I provided for the family and gave him a few dollars now and then.</p>
<p>He was killed a couple of years later, in an accident crossing the street, and I didn't even collect any insurance. He was drunk at the time, the insurance company man said, and he was crossing the street in the mid­dle of the block, so it was his fault and I couldn't claim any compensation. Mr. Hirsch got me a lawyer free to look into the matter, but it was no use. It was a clearcut case and it was against me. The man who ran over my hus­band did send me one hundred dollars, out of sheer kindness; he didn't have to because it wasn't his fault.</p>
<p>That's when the really bad time began for me. Ellie was nine and getting to be a big girl quick. We lived in East Harlem then, and Ellie had a key to the apartment for when she came back from school and she was supposed to pick up Richard and bring him home and look after him that he shouldn't get into trouble until I got back mostly between seven and eight, except of course when Mrs. Hirsch was entertaining one of her women's clubs in the afternoon or having company for dinner in the evening and then of course I had to work later cleaning up, for which they always paid me extra and paid me handsomely too, and also there was lots of good food that I was always free to take home.</p>
<p>Ellie was a good girl, I always said, but left alone like that every afternoon with nobody to look after her, I suppose sooner or later it was bound to happen--I've seen it happen too many times before in other families to think different. She started having friends, boys and girls, come to visit her at the house while I was away. I met some of them when I used to come back from the Hirschs, and I did notice how the boys were considerably older, thirteen and fourteen, when Ellie was only ten and eleven, and some of the girls were older too. And then of course I knew they smoked, for I saw the butts and smelled the smoke, and that wasn't too bad, I thought--lots of kids smoke young nowadays. But after a while, and Ellie was then twelve going on thirteen, they began using the apart­ment for drinking parties. I'd thought for a while that I detected liquor on Ellie's breath a couple of times when I came home, and I scolded her for it. "Is that how you take care of Richard when I am away?" I said, and she explained that she had sent Richard out to play, and in any case it was just a drop, no more, that one of the boys had on him. And it went on like this for a while and I knew what was going on and pretended not to know for I couldn't do anything about it. On Sundays, when I was mostly off except when Mrs. Hirsch specially needed me for some reason, I tried to spend most of the time with Ellie and Richard, and I did try to talk to her a lot and be friends with her. "Ellie, you want to be careful what you are doing," I used to tell her, "or you might get in serious trouble." "What trouble, Ma?" she said. "Drinking trouble," I said. "Drinking can lead to all kinds of trouble and you a young girl"--she was thirteen then--"and you got all your life ahead of you and want to be careful." "Don't you worry about me," she'd say, "I know how to take care of myself"--imagine a thirteen-year old knowing how to take care of herself, they're all so cocksure of themselves. And mostly she'd avoid talking too much with me and run off under one pretext or another, now it was a friend's birthday party she was invited to, and then a bunch of them had decided to get together at some­body's house and listen to some records, or some such reason, so that little by little I didn't see much of my daughter.</p>
<p>I came home one time and found Ellie dead drunk and did what I could to make her comfortable. The next morning I called Mrs. Hirsch and begged off for the day. Ellie had a terrible hangover and when she started getting over it, I talked to her. "I warned you," I told her, "I warned you time and again. You cut out these friends of yours that are making you drink and leading you to all kinds of trouble." She listened allright and was contrite, and, "Yes, Ma," she said, "Yes, Ma," again and again.</p>
<p>But what's the use. A young girl and no supervision and the neigh­borhood was bad. I couldn't blame her, and I couldn't blame myself, either. Nobody was to blame, it seemed, but things were bad, and I knew they'd get worse.</p>
<p>I had some trouble with the boy too, but boys are different so I didn't mind that much; I worried about Ellie most. Richard started hanging around with a bunch of tough kids in the street and then they started run­ning over to the white neighborhoods and swiping things from stores. Then they formed a gang, little as they were, for my Richard was then only eleven, and had fights with kids in other blocks. A number of times he came home badly beaten up, and he skipped school, but I didn't see much of him and he wouldn't listen to me when I did see him, and, as I said, boys are different, and what could I do anyway.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it happened when Ellie was fourteen. I came home one night from the Hirschs, and there she was, looking sick and troubled. "What's the matter, honey," I said. "Not feeling well?" "I'm allright," she said, but I could see she wasn't and it didn't take me long to find out what was the trouble, because she was really anxious to tell me, she was that scared.</p>
<p>She was in bad trouble, for she was three months gone. "Why didn't you tell me, honey? Why didn't you tell me before?" I pleaded with her. But of course, she had been too scared to tell me and her friends gave all kinds of advice what to do that would help her the way it helped some of them, all kinds of exercises and pills and what not, but in this case it didn't work. And now she broke down and cried and was desperate.</p>
<p>"Who is the boy?" I asked her. "Who is it from?" I don't rightly know why I asked her this. What difference did it really make. Supposing I did know who the boy responsible for it was, if he was considerably older, why then, maybe he could be persuaded to marry her, till after the baby was born and then, well, perhaps give it away to somebody for adoption, for Ellie was only fourteen at this time, and even if she was fifteen by the time the baby was born, she was too young to be a mother. But Ellie didn't rightly know who the boy was, for there had been a number of them for some time, and also the drinking parties when she'd sometimes blank out and remember nothing and also reefers and so she couldn't rightly tell.</p>
<p>I was heartbroken, I tell you. I had had hopes for Ellie. For some reason I thought she'd grow up to be a teacher. I'd talked to the Hirschs about Ellie and what a good and bright girl she was, and Mrs. Hirsch had made me some promise that if Ellie kept up good work at school, why, after a while they'd help her go to college and become a teacher. My father, he was an unskilled laborer come up from the South. My late husband was a skilled man. I'd sure wanted Ellie to be a teacher. And now she was in this trouble and so young. I cheered her as much as I could. First I suggested that she have the baby, that she go to stay with some relatives we have in Philly, and we could let on she was married only her husband ran off or got in trouble with the law or something and that's why she had to stay with them. And then we could give the baby away for adoption. But Ellie wouldn't even hear of it, she was that scared of having a baby and didn't want to be away from me.</p>
<p>So there was but one thing to do and a couple of days later when Ellie seemed to calm down a bit, I called Pat Lawrence and made arrange­ments for her to rid Ellie of her trouble the very next day as it was already late and couldn't wait. Pat did this sort of thing regularly and had a good record--she only lost one or two cases in a good many years of practice and she was reasonable about rates--really showed consideration if you were hard up. She worked at home and some people did call her butcher, but just the same she was liked in the neighborhood and there weren't many women in blocks and blocks who hadn't come to her at one time or another.</p>
<p>"Don't be scared, Ellie," I said wishing to cheer her up. "It won't take more than just a little while and you'll be rid of your trouble and nobody hardly will know, and if this will teach you more than I could, why then it will be for the best and you'll never be in this kind of trouble again, and you'll keep proper company and eventually go to college and be a teacher and marry a fine young man and have the babies you want." Poor thing, she acted as brave as she could, and Pat Lawrence cheered her too, and then I was asked to wait in the living room while Pat worked on Ellie, and I stuffed my fingers in my ears.</p>
<p>It looked at first as if all went well and Pat gave Ellie some sort of pills to take for a day or two. But it wasn't allright. Ellie kept on bleeding and bleeding and soon she became feverish and I called a doctor in our neighborhood, a fine colored young man, and we were all proud of him. But he couldn't help much either. Ellie died a week later. This young doctor, he wanted Ellie to go to a hospital, but Ellie was scared, and I didn't know what to say. I was a little afraid myself because there was Pat mixed up in it and she wouldn't hear of a hospital and kind of began threatening that Ellie must stay home or else. She didn't say or else what, but in our neighborhood Pat is not only liked--she is also listened to. She got all sorts of connections, if you know what I mean, consider­ing her business, and if she suggests something like this, she's generally listened to, unless one is looking for a heap of trouble.</p>
<p>So my Ellie died, and again we had some trouble with this fine young colored doctor, who said he had to report the cause of death to the proper office downtown, and Pat again made it pretty plain that she wouldn't hear of it, that the doctor better put down pneumonia or flu or something like that as the cause of death, unless he wanted to give up his practice quick and move out of the neighborhood and far away just as quick.</p>
<p>This he did, and I don't blame him. I don't blame anybody; it's just that if you got bad luck, you got bad luck.</p>
<p>It was a short time after this that the Hirschs moved. They gave up their apartment on Riverside Drive and moved up to a fine house they bought near Yonkers. Their boys were away at college and came home only for facations, so all there was left was Mr. and Mrs. Hirsch and Sandy. They moved to this fine house and asked me to come stay with them. It was a pretty big house, though not too big, and Mrs. Hirsch still entertained a lot and had her women's clubs, and there was Sandy. So they had fixed up a nice room in the basement for me. It was comfortable and cozy, and also dry and light and well-heated. The rest of the basement had once been some kind of a playroom for the children of the former owner. I begged Richard to come and stay with me, for there was plenty of room in the basement and the Hirschs had no objections at all to his staying with me, but he stayed for only about a week and went back to East Harlem to live with a sister of mine. I guess he missed his gang and his friends and must have felt pretty lonesome in this fancy neighborhood where he was about the only colored boy. What could he do there to amuse himself?</p>
<p>Sandy became like a daughter to me. She was Ellie's age, I told you. And she got more and more beautiful as time went on. People stopped to stare at her in the street. And I was more like a mother to her than her own mother who was so busy most of the time, though she did take care to see that Sandy did her homework, and got home on time and went to bed at a reasonable hour. But it takes more than that to be a mother and so Sandy turned to me. If she had a problem, she'd come to me, and I was happy to have her come to me, she made me think of Ellie so. And first the problems weren't anything much--the usual girl problems, about her friends and their jealousies, and parties, and boys here and there and which boy liked which girl best. That was not her problem; with her looks and her personality, Sandy could have any boy she wanted; there was that much about her that was dark royalty that competition from other girls wasn't what worried her any time. Though, it's funny, for all this she often felt not sure of herself, and the more she was the queen of every party the more she felt unsure, and if ever one boy showed some partiality to another girl she was heartbroken for days. And then she started worry­ing about what was right to do and what wasn't, and if some boy held hands with her too long, should she allow it, and wasn't he getting fresh, and what to do if a boy wanted to kiss her and such like girlish stuff.</p>
<p>For you must remember that the Hirschs are the finest people, and they brought up Sandy strict and no fooling around beyond what is proper. But now she was growing up and going on sixteen and having all sorts of feelings and so she'd come to me and she'd tell me all the things she didn't tell her own mother and she'd ask my advice and I loved her like my own daughter.</p>
<p>"Sandy," I told her once around this time, "you got to live right, like your folks taught you, but there is another lesson you got to learn if you are to live a full life: Learn to wear your life loose, like a bathrobe, otherwise it will strangle you." That's what I told her, for she was full of life and very beautiful.</p>
<p>Boyfriends used to call on her now, nice college boys driving up in their cars and picking her up to take her to dances and to movies and to parties and bringing her back all hours of the night, and sometimes, when they brought her back, they'd sit in the car together, other times they'd go for walks, and then I noticed she'd bring her friends into the base­ment, that part that used to be a playroom for the children of the former owner and was across a narrow hallway from my room. She begged me: "Don't tell daddy and mamma." I didn't. Now she was a real dark young queen and when she looked at someone that party felt he was being looked at from a height. She wasn't that tall, though she was a big girl, but with those eyes, and with that cloud of black, curly, almost kinky hair, one couldn't help looking up at her.</p>
<p>The next fall she went off to some fancy girls' college somewhere way up in Vermont. What a to do there was in the house: And all the preparations, buying clothes and things, and packing, and doing this and that, and Mrs. Hirsch cut down on her activities for a while, it was late summer anyway, to get everything ready, and she went up with Sandy to that college town a couple of weeks in advance and found her suitable lodgings, and then went with Sandy when college opened for a day or two to make sure she was comfortable in every way.</p>
<p>And this I recall, for it was a little funny but it shows you the kind of people the Hirschs are. The night before Sandy left, when all her luggage was already packed, Mrs. Hirsch called me in to help her with some­thing, and it was this. She wrote out on maybe twenty small scraps of paper messages such as: "We Love You; We Miss You Every Day; Come To See Us Soon; The House Is Empty Without You." And now she asked me to help her unpack all of Sandy's suitcases and she slipped these pieces of paper into Sandy's clothes here and there and then we repacked the suitcases just as they had been, so that for many weeks when Sandy was away in college she would find these messages from time to time.</p>
<p>The house did seem empty a while, but not too much so. There were visits from the boys, David and Monroe, who went to colleges not far away and occasionally dropped in for a weekend. My Richard would come up now and then but he'd only stay a couple of hours, and mostly he came to ask me for money and didn't hardly talk about himself or what he was doing. And there were a lot of letters from Sandy and she wrote me a lot too, and she didn't neglect to mention once or twice the advice I gave her about wearing one's life loose, like a bathrobe, lest it strangle. She did come home for Christmas vacation, and she talked a little to me too, but most of the time she was too busy with her social life and parties and all that, so that we hardly saw her more than around noon time. Then she went back to her college.</p>
<p>She came again in the spring, but before the regular spring vacation, I could tell right away there was something wrong, that look on her face reminded me of Ellie so. She gave some excuse to her parents, something about taking her examinations earlier--I don't know, it was something like that. And that first night home she came to my basement room to talk to me. "May, I'm in trouble," she said, and the light was out of her eyes, though that black mass of hair was still like a dark cloud over her head. "I need your help." "A girl like you, how could you," I said. But though she looked badly shook up she didn't seem sorry. "I followed your advice," she said. "I wore my life loose, not too loose but loose, so it shouldn't strangle me, the way I saw it do to many others. Now you must help me. I could do nothing about it up there in Vermont, so I hurried down here. It is not too late--between six weeks and two months. You can help me."</p>
<p>I did the best I could. I asked Mrs. Hirsch for a few days off. I said I had to be with my son. Sandy, she said she was going to New York to stay with some friends a couple of days. She checked in a hotel and then I took her to Pat Lawrence. I had faith in Pat, in spite of what happened to Ellie, for she had much experience.</p>
<p>Everything went off well, or so it seemed at first. A couple of days later Sandy went back to her parents, and I also returned, and then she went back to her college. She kept on writing as usual, but I could feel that things were not right. Mrs. Hirsch went up once later that spring to visit with Sandy. She said she found her in high spirits, but for some reason I knew this wasn't so, that something was wrong with my Sandy. And I was right. When Sandy came back for the summer vacation I could see in her face that something terrible had happened to her and a few days later she told me herself what it was. She didn't tell her mother and father, but she did tell me, because I had been like a mother to her for many years now, even though I was only May, the colored servant.</p>
<p>What happened was this. Pat's operation had been successful and Sandy was rid of her trouble, but after she got back to college Sandy didn't feel right at all. She went to a doctor after a while and what happened was that an infection had set in after Pat's operation. It had been neglected too long and now Sandy badly needed another operation, a serious one. It was done, to save her life. "And now," Sandy told me, "I will never be able to have children."</p>
<p>She confided in me. "But you must never tell daddy or mumma," she warned me. "It would kill them."</p>
<p>I promised her to keep mum, and I did all that summer till Sandy was about to gack to her college.</p>
<p>What made me break my pledge and tell, I don't know. I thought I was doing the right thing, but maybe it was a little devil, an evil little devil that made me do it.</p>
<p>I told Mr. Hirsch first. That was strange, I admit, for I had never talked much to him during all those years. It was Mrs. Hirsch that I dealt with all the time.</p>
<p>One evening after I had cleaned up after supper, and Mrs. Hirsch had gone out to some meeting or other and Mr. Hirsch was reading a paper in the living room, I went up to him and said, "I want to talk to you about some­thing important, Mr. Hirsch." I hadn't thought of doing so a minute before, and then suddenly I upped and said it.</p>
<p>"Yes, May," he said and put away his paper. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"It's about Sandy," I said. "You ought to know."</p>
<p>"About Sandy?" he asked.</p>
<p>"She's in a bad way," I said, "and I thought you ought to know." And then I went on and told him about Sandy's trouble at first, and what Pat Lawrence did for her, and what happened afterward.</p>
<p>"Did Sandy ask you to tell us?" he asked.</p>
<p>"No," I said. "Sandy particularly asked me not to tell you or Mrs. Hirsch. But after all the things you did for me all these years, I thought I ought to tell you, that you ought to know, for she sure will need your help from now on more than ever before, and you ought to know."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Claymore," he said--that was the first time in many years he called me Mrs. Claymore--"thank you Mrs. Claymore. You may go now."</p>
<p>I saw him die before my eyes. All he did was kind of flop back in his chair. But I saw him die all the same.</p>
<p>One more question he asked me, "Does Mrs. Hirsch know about this?"</p>
<p>"She doesn't know," I said. "Sandy asked me to keep it secret.</p>
<p>She confided in me only because I have been like a mother to her all those years."</p>
<p>"Allright," he said. "Please go now." That's all he said.</p>
<p>And I told Mrs. Hirsch too; the next day I told her. She is Sandy's real mother and should know.</p>
<p>What followed was beyond belief. Mr. Hirsch called in Sandy and questioned her. She admitted the truth as I told it. He was furious at first. Then he cried. And then Mrs. Hirsch had some kind of breakdown when she heard about it. She just took to her bed. And Sandy, she walked about pretty glum. Didn't say a word. Didn't blame me either for telling. Only the light went out of her eyes, and even her halo of black hair seemed to have collapsed somehow.</p>
<p>In time she went back to her college and the next year she trans­ferred to some other school way out West somewhere. But things aren't the same in the house. Mrs. Hirsch is at home most of the time and doesn't entertain much now—hardly at all. Just as kind as ever before, only sort of silent. Mr. Hirsch, I hardly ever see him. He is out of town more than ever and when he does come in, he hardly shows himself except at dinner time. They don't talk much to each other either, so far as I can see. And for some reason they stopped calling me May and call me Mrs. Claymore now, all the time.</p>
<p>The way they are, I am a little scared of them now and keep out of their way. That leaves me a lot of time and I think much--of Ellie, and Sandy, of course.</p>
<p>I had to tell them, though. They are the finest people. People don't come any finer, so how could I keep them ignorant?</p>
