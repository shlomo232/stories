    <h1>The Dictator Doubts</h1>
<p>The Dictator was old. He was still hale and his doctors assured him that he would live many years more. "You will live to be at least a hun­dred," they said. "You must live many more years. What would our great country do without your superb leadership?" Whenever the doctors said this to him, the Dictator would glance at the map of his huge country handing on the wall, and agree with them. "Indeed," he would think to himself, "how could this country manage without me?"</p>
<p>But despite the assurances of his doctors the Dictator felt old age creeping up on him. He felt tired and fulfilled. The revolution which had elevated him to his great power had taken place long, long ago. It had all happened so far back that the Dictator himself did not remember the details distinctly, and he sometimes felt as if they had happened to another person with whom he had been intimately acquainted. At such times, in order to reassure himself, he would pick up a copy of the history of the revolu­tion he had led which had been specially printed for him on parchment.</p>
<p>This copy was always on his desk. He would turn the pages at random and read a paragraph here and there. He particularly liked to read the account of the revolutionary war against his enemies, and as he did so he would sigh: "Ah, those were the days:" He would then recall how, mounted on a black charger, he had led the citizens of the capital in a furious dash against the enemy. He would remember the stormy sessions of the revolu­tionary junta when it debated the course of the revolutionary war and his opinions always prevailed. Another topic about which he read avidly was the story of his struggle against his enemies within the revolutionary party who had tried to deprive him of his power. Almost all of them had been killed long ago. But the Dictator always reexperienced a thrill of triumph as he read about it. "The dirty . . ." he would chuckle to himself.</p>
<p>The Dictator's assistants were men much younger than he. They all believed that he was all-wise, but in the manner of young men they allowed themselves one liberty when not in his presence. This liberty was small enough and consisted in referring to the Dictator as "Uncle." They too were convinced that the Dictator would live many years more and often wondered what they would do after he died. Though some of them cherished secret ambitions, not one of them seriously thought himself capable of supplanting "Uncle." But in the vigor of their youth they could not help noticing the Dictator's growing senility, and in order not to tire him excessively they submitted to him only digests of reports and tried to make these optimistic. Unfavorable news was almost entirely withheld from the Dictator.</p>
<p>Twice each day for two hours the Dictator read and initiated these reports. Everything was going well with his empire and he was glad that his people were getting more out of life. Many years before he had pro­claimed the slogan: "Life will be more joyful under my leadership." He was pleased to see himself proved right in this too. The wheat yield this year is five percent above last year's, one report stated, and the Dictator approvingly smacked his aged lips. "Good, good," he muttered. Our army has acquired another hundred thousand tanks and is now invincible against all enemies within and without, another report informed him. The Dictator particularly appreciated this bit of news. As an old army man he believed in military preparedness and was never satisfied with what he had. In a shaky hand he wrote on the margin of the report: "Not bad but also not adequate. Vigilance is the watchword. Our enemies never sleep. We must be prepared to exterminate the mad dogs at all times."</p>
<p>But though he warned against enemies, it was mere habit, for the Dictator knew that he was stronger than any of them. It was a good idea, however, to keep the young men on their toes. There must be no slackness, and from time to time it was best to upbraid them a little.</p>
<p>Like all old men the Dictator fell into the habit of going to sleep early and waking after midnight. His mind was especially alert during these vigils. He carefully considered his decisions on the reports of the day and planned directives for the following day. But there were not many directives to issue. Everything was proceeding smoothly and no rivals were in sight. The though of rivals always raised the Dictator's blood pressure a little bit. He could never get over the fact that one of his bitterest enemies had escaped his vengeance and fled to a distant country where eventually he died a natural death. Whenever the Dictator thought of this man he felt frustrated. He had slipped up somewhere. He should have had the borders guarded more closely. As he visualized his erstwhile rival living in com­fort in the foreign capital and attended by skilled doctors and nurses on his death bed, the Dictator liked to imagine the tortures he would have wished to inflict on him.</p>
<p>But such vindictive thoughts did not monopolize the Dictator's attention. As he grew older he thought less and less about his former enemies and became preoccupied with a scheme for further increasing his fame and his influence on the people. Since there was nothing more of a militantly constructive nature to be done by him, he decided to undertake one last great work for his beloved people. This was to be a final summa­tion of the benefits of the revolution he had led. He would show his people the exact measure of gain they had made under his leadership. The work, in the form of a book, was to be called "Lessons of the Revolution" and was not to be published till after he had died. It would be his final testa­ment to the world and to his people, conclusive and irrefutable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After his eightieth birthday, when the clamor of the celebrations died down, the Dictator began his labors. He worked only at night when he felt most alert and when his attention was not distracted by other busi­ness. In his usual systematic manner he began gathering data for his testament from latest reports as well as from authentic accounts of the condition of the country at the time of the revolution. After working for a year he felt that he had sufficient data for his testament. All that remained to be done was to add up the various figures contained in the data. After that he could proceed to the final formulation of his testament.</p>
<p>On the night preceding his eighty-first birthday he began adding the figures which were to demonstrate to the world the magnitude of his life's work. He had a vague and unarticulated plan to release a summary of his findings on the following day. He therefore applied himself to the night's work with great earnestness.</p>
<p>He began with the population of the country—the same people whom he loved so much and to whose welfare he had devoted all his life. He and his subordinates had made the revolution to improve the lot of the poor people and to do away with injustice and evildoers. At the time of the revolution there had been one hundred million people in the country. Of this number twenty million people had been happy, but their happiness and welfare were a result of the exploitation of the poor. Thirty million people had been happy without doing any harm to others. The remaining fifty million people had led a life of misery.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," the Dictator said to himself, "there had been much injustice and wrong in the country. I have done away with it. Now let me add up the figures as they are now and even my enemies abroad will have to admit that I have been a benefactor of humanity."</p>
<p>He carefully began to add. Twenty million persons had been killed in the course of the revolution on both sides. Another ten million people, enemies of the revolution, had fled abroad and spent their remaining days in misery and humiliation as impoverished refugees or, at best, as taxi drivers or entertainers in cheap night clubs. Another twenty million people died during the famines that accompanied the early years of the revolution and in all kinds of hard labor while trying to rebuild the country. Altogether, fifty million people.</p>
<p>The Dictator blinked as he looked at the total. It was incredible. Fifty million lives had been sacrificed to repair the wrong done to another fifty million people. Could it be true? He checked his figures. There was no error in his addition. Furthermore, he recalled distinctly that by the end of the fifth year of his revolution the population of the country had been reduced to half. His enemies abroad had then taunted him with this fact. They had even said that the remaining people were far from happy, but, of course, that had been mere enemy propaganda.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, of course, why didn't I think of it," the Dictator said to himself. "Now the population of the country is once more one hundred million. I almost overlooked such an obvious fact. Now this will account for everything." And he diligently applied himself to his notes.</p>
<p>It was a fact. The country once more had a population of one hundred million. The Dictator took the congratulatory telegrams that lay on his desk. They had been sent to him on the occasion of his forthcoming eighty-first birthday. There had been many of them, so many that his assistants classified them into categories to make their scope more easily grasped and appreciated by him. He eagerly glanced through the figures. Here, no doubt, he would find the confirmation he sought. His aged fingers trembled as he rapidly did the addition. The members of all the trade unions and their families wished the Dictator a long life and thanked him for happiness. There were twenty-two million of them altogether. The armed forces thanked him for leading them to victory and wished the Dicta­tor many years of further glorious leadership. There were eight million of them. The youth organization of the State party—eight million of them—said he was responsible for their happy youth. Six million government em­ployees and a total of six million others, scattered throughout the country, were also on record.</p>
<p>The Dictator scanned the figures and added them mentally. They came to fifty million.</p>
<p>In excitement he pressed the buzzer on his desk. Though it was now three o'clock in the morning a number of guards were always on duty outside and one of them immediately rushed in and saluted.</p>
<p>"Bring me file Z," the Dictator said without looking up from his papers.</p>
<p>The guard saluted and backed out. A few minutes later an official obsequiously bowed in and laid the desired file on the desk. He waited a moment, but when the Dictator said nothing, he quietly went out.</p>
<p>File Z was one of the most secret documents in the country. It con­tained the complete figures of all prisoners, criminal as well as political, and also lists of undesirable elements in the country who, because of their doubtful loyalty, had been deprived of civil rights, full rations, or had been punished in other ways.</p>
<p>The prison population of the country consisted of four million. Another four million were political dissidents who, though not imprisoned, had been exiled to remote parts of the empire and their families were not allowed to follow them. Both groups, together with their families, num­bered thirty-two million persons. Another eighteen million were accounted for as persons whose rations had been reduced as a disciplinary measure, offspring of former political enemies and members of national and racial groups considered undesirable or unreliable. Altogether, fifty million people.</p>
<p>The Dictator rubbed his eyes. What kind of tricks were these fig­ures playing on him? But though he checked them several times, the result was always the same.</p>
<p>"I'll come back to them later," the Dictator said as he pushed aside the numbered slips of paper on which he had done his addition. "They require more careful consideration, in any case, because there is the individual element to be reckoned with. Neither happiness nor misery is the same in quantity or quality in any two persons. And though the figures are the same now as they were at the time of the revolution, the nature of the happiness enjoyed now under a regime of justice is no doubt superior to the happiness of former times. More materialistic data will be less misleading."</p>
<p>He therefore began checking the figures on wheat production. Wheat means bread, he said to himself. The quantity of bread people consume is a definite index of their well-being. For a good many years now our wheat production has been mounting consistently. If I can prove a substantial increase in per capita bread consumption in the country it will suffice to demonstrate the superiority of the regime.</p>
<p>Ever since the revolution it had been the custom of the Dictator's country to publish annual production figures in terms of percentages instead of in quantities. This was done to mislead the outside world and to with­hold from it information concerning the internal affairs of the country.</p>
<p>The Dictator now listed the wheat production of the year preceding the revolution as one hundred percent and made his calculations on this basis. At first there was a very sharp decline in production which dropped to twenty-five percent as the population was cut in half and farming was disrupted. Slowly but steadily the curve of wheat production rose. There were occasional dips in the curve for the years when there was drought or the country was at war and many young men from the farms were drafted into the army. But the trend was constantly upward.</p>
<p>The Dictator translated the percentages into numbers of bushels. The production of wheat for the last year had reached the one hundred percent mark—exactly the same as it had been the year before the revolu­tion.</p>
<p>The Dictator telephoned the war department. "Tell me at once," he said to the general on night duty, "how many soldiers were court martialed and shot this year and how many the year before I came to power?"</p>
<p>The general begged for a moment to consult his files, then he returned to the telephone with the information. When he finished speaking, the Dictator said nothing and silently replaced the telephone receiver.</p>
<p>The general said: "Four hundred and sixty-seven soldiers were shot for revolutionary activities the year before the revolution when the total population of the country had been one hundred million. Four hundred and sixty-seven soldiers were shot for counter-revolutionary activities during the past year when the population of the country once more reached the one hundred million mark."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What will I tell my people tomorrow when they come to congratulate me on my eighty-first birthday?" the Dictator thought. "There must be a lesson somewhere in all these figures, strange as they are. A law of social dynamics is no doubt hidden in them. Everything in life is governed by laws—there are no accidents. If I were to be frank with the people how would I formulate this new law for them?"</p>
<p>The Dictator took a slip of clean paper and wrote in capital letters: THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF JUSTICE.</p>
<p>When he finished these words he thought a long time, then he wrote:</p>
<p>"On the basis of careful observation it appears that the amount of justice per capita available in the world remains unchanged. The distribu­tion of this justice may vary from one individual to another. But it may be said with good reason that the percentage of persons suffering injustice at any one time is the same as at any other time."</p>
<p>The Dictator was so cautious in his wording because he was an old man. In his younger days he would have been much more emphatic about his conclusions. He went on:</p>
<p>"Justice as well as injustice thus appear to be indestructible, in the same way that matter or energy cannot be destroyed. At birth each person appears to bring with himself into the world a certain quantum of justice and injustice whose size has not yet been determined. These quanta may be shifted about to some extent between individuals and groups as a result of revolutionary activity. But it always remains a case of redis­tribution; never a case of the substitution of justice for injustice.</p>
<p>"Since I hold the above to be true, it may be said that there is no justice in the world. For if a certain, universally fixed, percentage of injustice is inevitable, and this percentage cannot be changed by human effort (and I, as a revolutionary materialist, do not believe in any other kind of effort) then we are the slaves of fate, and slavery of this or of any other kind is the greatest injustice possible.</p>
<p>"At the end of many years of leadership on behalf of my people I am therefore forced to the conclusion that . . . "</p>
<p>The Dictator's hands, which had been trembling ever more noticeably as he wrote the preceding reflections, now began shaking violently. The pencil held between his fingers made a few illegible strokes then dropped to the floor. The Dictator slid back on his chair, his eyes closed and his head came to rest on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Some hours later when the adjutant of the day knocked on the Dicta­tor's door, there was no answer. Some high officials were quickly summoned and they decided to force the door open. The Dictator was dead.</p>
<p>They reverently placed him on his bed, then carefully gathered into a folder the pieces of paper from his desk without reading them:</p>
<p>"These must be locked in the vaults of the national museum," they said.</p>
