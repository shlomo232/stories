    <h1>Claustrophobia</h1>
    <p>They nod their heads knowingly, with understanding, with sympathy, with sophistication when you tell them. Of course, of course, they say; a good friend of theirs, someone they know, suffers from it too. Many do, nowadays; it's nothing to be self-conscious about, they assure you. And they smile forgivingly as they say goodbye and move off.</p>
<p>And then something inside you prompts you to look back when they are only a couple of steps away, and, yes, there can be no mistake about it—they, are shrugging their shoulders and you can almost hear them saying: "Who'd have expected it of him! Crazy! And the way he carried on about it, a little thing like that, you'd think he was dying of galloping consumption. Y-e-e-s	. . ."--this last in a tone of total despair.</p>
<p>"Idiot!" you curse yourself. "Why did you have to tell these peo­ple that you suffer from claustrophobia? It isn't as if they were close friends of yours. Mere acquaintances. And when they mentioned the New Year's party they were planning in their seventeenth story apartment, there wasn't even a hint of a suggestion that you too were on their planned guest list. You were not confronted with the challenge of an automatic elevator which just possibly might get stuck between floors. So why did you have to open your big mouth?"</p>
<p>But it was inevitable. For though it is commonly laughed off as a minor and slightly ridiculous malady, claustrophobia actually partakes of some of the characteristics of a crime. Like crime it is accompanied by a compulsion to confess. (So did Raskolnikov have to go ringing the bell of the apartment of the woman he murdered?) And thus it comes about that you inevitably lead conversation from simple chit-chat to the irrepressible announcement: "Me, I suffer from a touch of claustrophobia. Not much really, only automatic elevators and subways, things like that, and not all the time, mind you, only . . ." And having made your confession you at once realize what you have done and usually make a weak and ineffectual attempt to cancel it. But it is too late. The confession is out and can no longer be retracted no matter what you say. And yet there is also a certain satisfaction. Now they know. Now everybody knows, for word of it will be passed on. It is humiliating, of course. Still . . ." Avoid situations of entrapment," the shrink had said when you first consulted him. At a dollar a minute you had expected something more profound. But there it was, and, gentleman that you are, you muttered thanks and walked out into a sunlit street where the dread of entrapment dissipates like a nightmare upon awakening.</p>
<p>Dissipates, but does not altogether disappear. It merely fades into the background, and for the moment you console yourself, you flatter your­self. You say: This business of claustrophobia from which you suffer is really a special gift, and only very sensitive, fine-grained persons with delicate psyches are afflicted by it. And you hope that now that you have demonstrated the delicacy of your sensibilities, why, next time you approach a small, automatic elevator you will step into it without qualms; it's door may slide shut like the lid of a coffin, still you won't mind. You will press the button of the floor you are going to without your eyes first roving over the panel in search of the alarm button—just in case. You just won't care, now that you have considered the matter and found the conclusion so eminently complimentary to yourself.</p>
<p>But then comes the moment of truth; you face the elevator door; you indulge in a moment of Hamletian indecision: To enter and risk being entombed in this mechanical contraption for a minute, or an hour, or a weekend, or to practice discretion and climb a few flights of stairs. Common sense triumphs. You enter. The door slides eerily. Then it clicks shut. Too late. Now you are at the mercy of a mechanism to which there is no appeal. You pretend indifference. The sealed chamber moves upward, ever so slowly. Why is it so slow? Is anything wrong with the machinery? Your breathing begins to come a little heavier as the elevator lumbers upward, seemingly lifting itself hand over hand. At last it is approaching your floor. Now it has slowed down still more. Is anything wrong now?</p>
<p>No, it is merely slowing down for the stop. Why then does it take so long? Let's see, you'll count to ten, and if by that time it does not reach your floor you will know that you are trapped, and then . . . Then what? Well, better not think about it. Take Caesar's advice and die but once. Some pressure is now felt in the chest. You begin to count. Don't cheat, you warn yourself; don't count too fast. By the time you reach six the elevator comes to a halt and the door begins to open. You step out slowly. What's the rush? The pressure in the chest subsides. To hell with Hamlet. And yet you could cry.</p>
<p>"How did it all begin?" the shrink had asked during one of the early sessions.</p>
<p>A good question, you sneer to yourself. If you had known what had really set it off, would you be there?</p>
<p>"When did the symptoms first appear, and what form did they take?" he simplifies his question.</p>
<p>Now, that's more to the point, you think. "The first symptoms, well, anxiety, in subways first, and then in automatic elevators." "Describe the symptoms in greater detail."</p>
<p>"Come to think of it," you say, "there had been a prehistory before the symptoms."</p>
<p>"?"</p>
<p>"Well, one reads, reports in the papers--children trapped in junked refrigerators and such like. One had always been reading such reports. And before there were refrigerators there were ice boxes. And so it went. One reads, one is moved, and then one files it away in a corner of the mind. Other times one identifies."</p>
<p>"And then?" the psychiatrist prods.</p>
<p>"Then imagination takes over, creative imagination."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>You oblige. You say: "There was that time when I had an idea for a play."</p>
<p>"A play?"</p>
<p>"Yes, a play, a drama," you tell him. "It went like this: New York is atom bombed--everybody was talking about atom bombs at that time-- and a subway train is caught under the East River, with both entrances to the tunnel sealed by the explosion. The tunnel itself is only slightly damaged so that the train is not flooded at once--the water seeps in slowly."</p>
<p>"No exit?"</p>
<p>"No escape," you agree. "Well, this is the situation; the rest is detail. You set up a cast of characters and develop their reactions to the situation."</p>
<p>"Did you ever write the play?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"No play or other type of creative literary work can be written before the situation it deals with had not first actually occurred some­where," you declare categorically.</p>
<p>"Oh!?" is all he says.</p>
<p>"Yes. And then, of course, the gas chambers. Auschwitz. Treblinka. Crammed in. Then the doors slam locked, and the gas begins to pour from the spouts. LET ME OUT! But the doors won't open."</p>
<p>"Is that what you think it felt like there? Were you ever trapped in a stalled elevator or subway train?"</p>
<p>"A couple of times. Briefly. Yes, that's what I think it felt like 'there'."</p>
<p>"A kind of emotional stigmata?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps," you say. "I am not sure."</p>
<p>The psychiatrist thinks a minute, then, "Tell me about the early symptoms. You mentioned anxiety. How did it express itself?"</p>
<p>You smile. "It's ridiculous--the forms it takes. Way back, in the very beginning, it was simply a matter of compulsively picking out the exit signs in movie theaters. That made sense. Any good general will leave himself an avenue of escape and will chart its course. Or take subway trains. First one looks for a seat near the door. At a later stage one goes to the front of the lead car. There one can—or could--see dimly into the tunnel ahead. Should the train stop between stations, one could see the red signals ahead. There must be another train ahead, or some other obstruction. It made sense. The train one is on isn't stalled; it's merely waiting for a clear track. Should the obstruction persist, the doors would no doubt be opened and the passengers evacuated. Of course, that sometimes led to fantasies of wandering in labyrinths of endless black tunnels. At a later stage one tends to go to the head of the subway plat­form to make sure that the signals are 'go' before entering the subway car. See?" you tell him, "it's not simply the entrapment that is fright­ening—it's the lack of known reason for it that terrifies. This is why an elevator that is man-operated is not frightening at all, because, say it gets stalled, then you can appeal to the operator who is presumably in con­trol of it, 'Hey, John, what's wrong?' or, 'Hey, John, do something about it.' Now John may or may not be able to do anything about it. But he represents authority, and one unconsciously trusts in his ability to master the situation. See what I mean?"</p>
<p>"Yes," the psychiatrist says, and you sense that he doesn't at all see what you mean.</p>
<p>So you try another angle, because it is very important that he should understand. You simply must make him understand, the same way you com­pulsively confess your handicap to every stray acquaintance, only causing them to shrug their shoulders and beat a hasty retreat. "Look," you say, "let me give you another example."</p>
<p>"Yes," he says again wearily. He seems to have a limited vocabulary.</p>
<p>"Now this example deals with a state of mind that is similar to claustrophobia though no spatial entrapment is involved. Supposing you go to a dentist and he shoves a trayful of soft plaster into your mouth to get an impression of your teeth, so that you can only gurgle incomprehensible sounds of distress. You want to spit it out, but control yourself, and in a few seconds it is too late to do so--the plaster has hardened. Well, as long as he, the dentist that is, stands around scratching his head, sterilizing his instruments or otherwise killing time, it's OK.</p>
<p>But let him leave the room, and panic begins closing in. There you are with a mouthful of rock that you cannot by yourself rid yourself of, and where is he? Maybe he went out to lunch. Maybe he forgot you existed and decided just then to take a four-week vacation. And what are you to do? You see? It boils down to the same thing--some authority to appeal to in distress. And when there is no such intelligent and humane authority, then . . . "</p>
<p>"You are an atheist?" the shrink wants to know.</p>
<p>"What else can one be in an age of technology?" you say, and then, if only to undo the overall impression you feel you have made on him, the impression that you are some sort of crank, the hopeless sort, from whom it is unethical to accept fees, you start showing off your intellect. "But the dialectics of the situation," you say sententiously, "the inner contradiction will change matters. Technology leads to atheism, but the terrors which technology produces will inevitably lead to the resurrection of faith in God. Look, the skyscrapers are climbing ever higher, claus­trophobic nightmares, fire traps from which there is no escape. To justify them it is said that they are means to control the climate in which man works. But actually they are huge refrigerators in which the children of God are trapped, immense gas chambers the cries of whose victims will be unheard outside. Many years ago there was published a book called "Christ in Concrete," about a construction worker who fell into a batch of soft concrete. Well," you continue with mounting feeling, "now there are tens of thousands of people immured in a single concrete structure, and not a case of Amantillado to ease their anguish. It's a trap, I tell you. They are all traps, cunningly contrived to lure us into them. We are told they are safe and comfortable. It's a trick. A time will come," you intone prophetically, "when the portcullises will be lowered shut in all of them. Bam! And no more exit. And all the elevators will be stalled in ten-­thousand-foot doorless shafts, and all the lights will go out, and count­less people will scurry in panic up and down endless stairways, and the air conditioning will fail in mid-July, and a symphony of hopeless shrieks will be stifled in these immense sealed concrete-and-aluminum boxes. While overhead ten thousand crippled space ships, each carrying its sample of humanity, will whirl forever, unable to return to earth.</p>
<p>"Notice the tricks they resort to," you continue in mounting excite­ment. "First they called these traps Temples of Business and Finance. Temples, no less. And to provide an illusion of reality to the deception they would occasionally even put a steeple or a spire on top, like the one on the Chrysler Building, to delude the unwary. Now there is more forth­rightness. Does a refrigerator need a cupola? Does a gas chamber need a spire? No more pretense of straining heavenward.</p>
<p>"Out of these traps! I say. Back to the reassuring freedom of the earth, to walk on it, to crawl on it, on all fours, on all sixes, on all hundreds like blessed centipedes."</p>
<p>Of course, you got carried away a bit, but no matter, you made your point, didn't you?</p>
<p>It turns out you haven't made your point at all, for suddenly he switches the talk to sex. You had known all along that he was an orthodox Freudian. But how did he manage to switch the topic without your noticing it? Training, you suppose. Now there is no help for it. You'll have to talk about it. One doesn't pay at the rate of a dollar-and-a-half a minute and then waste time being reluctant. There is also the possibility that it might make sense. So you tell him a story—not really a story, but let's say an anecdote. So there was this young woman, you begin, whom you met somewhere or other, and the planets seemed to be in proper alignment. She was—well she was all one could ask for. And rapport was established almost instantaneously. You say, yes, and she says, of course. You say, one, and she responds, two. In short, it soon became obvious that she was not averse to stooping to a little folly. We are moderns, after all. All very well so far. But at this point the compulsion to confess which I mentioned before asserted itself and you blurt out the truth about your claustrophobia. And wouldn't you know it? She happens to have a cute little studio apart­ment on a twenty-fifth floor, served by a slow-moving automatic elevator. A veritable horror out of Poe. Now, if you hadn't confessed and she hadn't made an issue of it, all would no doubt have worked out fine. Amor omnia vincit. But she did begin to tease. Naturally, your hackles rose. Don't worry, you assure her. It's no problem. You'll walk up, you'll skip up those twenty-four little flights; if necessary you'll crawl up every one of them. But she wouldn't buy the idea. You'll be all worn out when you get there, she says. It makes sense, too. Well then, lower a rope ladder, you say. Like they used to do in the Middle Ages. But it turns out she only has some twine in the house. Then tear up a couple of sheets and make a rope. It is not practical, she says.</p>
<p>The lady is obviously backtracking, and that makes you mad. For her, you declare venomously, you'll develop a twenty-four story erection.</p>
<p>The climate which up to that point had been mild April suddenly changes to mid-February. Very funny, she says icily. What's funny about it, you cry. Similar feats have been performed in the past. Was swimming the Hellespont, or the Bosporus--or was it the Bering Strait--any less a feat? Was that funny? You are very funny, she announces with finality, and that is that.</p>
<p>You look around the shrink's office, perhaps for the first time thoroughly, and you notice: where usually his diploma hangs, or perhaps a photo of the doctor addressing some science conference, there hands a framed embroidered text--the God Bless Our. Home kind--of an old Ukrainian maxim, nema pisni bez divky--meaning there is no song without a girl in it somewhere or other. Oh, well, you think, everyone to his favorite phobia-- or mania.</p>
<p>But the walls are closing in, the automatic doors are jammed and nobody is within earshot to hear the cries of alarm. "What do you suggest should be done?" the shrink asks. You are ready with answers, for you had been thinking about this for a long time now. "What should be done?" you echo his question. "Here's what. Let everybody be provided with, and always carry on his person, the means of instant self-destruction, some kind of cyanide pill, for instance, like the ones they treasured in the European ghettos, or the kind that astronauts are given to be used in case their space capsule goes haywire and starts off on an eternal orbit around the sun or around Jupiter. That would weaken the force of the encroaching terror, the hopelessness of entrapment, by providing an avenue of escape. Then, too, organize patrols to go from house to house and from door to door. Knock on every wall and door and cry: Is anybody trapped inside?"</p>
<p>"But in the long run there is but one way out. Let me explain. It is generally accepted that our urban technological civilization will come to an end in an atomic holocaust. I don't believe this. It's too simple. Besides, a watched pot doesn't boil. What will happen will be less dramatic and more gradual. First one and then another—and there already are many—will be stricken with claustrophobia, with an uncontrol­lable dread of the contraptions that threaten to immure them. They will be laughed at first, and then those who laughed will in turn be invaded by the same anxiety and will begin to look nervously for the alarm button every time they enter an automatic elevator. Their lives will be filled with terror and shame. But soon the shame will fade and only the fear will re­main. They will look at skyscrapers with suspicion, and at every automatic gadget with distrust. Will it not stall? Or go berserk? Then they will begin to run away, offering lame alibis, or none. Until in the end the city will stand abandoned, the automatic mechanisms that made it work rusting to dust, crumbling.</p>
<p>"Therefore flee, for vertical Sodom is doomed."</p>
