    <h1>The Salvation of Germany</h1>
    <p class=topnote>A chapter from a larger work.</p>
<p class=topnote>[Jewish Frontier, February 1951, p.8-12]</p>

<p>IT HAD RAINED heavily all afternoon. By four o'clock the rain stopped and though the sky remained overcast Jacob left his room. He aim­lessly wandered about, stopping now and then to stare at the water rushing furiously in the gutters of the steep streets. The downpour had. washed away much red clay that clings to the rocks in Jerusalem, and the water looked like blood. Indistinct thoughts slowly moved through his brain but none of them gained hold. The side streets were almost deserted.</p>
<p>At the intersection of Jaffa Road and Chan­cellor Street, Jacob almost collided with Nahum Steinman. He was anxious to cut the encounter short. Nahum had made a painful impression upon him the time he first met him two weeks earlier. A refugee, anxious, insecure, Jacob had then impatiently classified him, most likely an emotional parasite eager to squeeze sympathy from every one he knew. At the moment Jacob did not feel sympathetic. He felt like a displaced person himself. But Nahum would not let him off easily and insisted that they go into a cafe for a while. Jacob followed him out of sheer inertia.</p>
<p>They went into Atarah Cafe, Jacob tagging after Nahum to an isolated table in a corner, Nahum appeared ,to be troubled by some idea and anxious to discuss it. Jacob mentally resigned himself to what, he was sure, would be an ordeal.</p>
<p>"Tell me about America," Nahum blurted out.</p>
<p>"My God!" Jacob inwardly recoiled with dis­pleasure that verged on disgust, "Another one. Wants to go to America and get rich."</p>
<p>The waiter discreetly placed before them two glasses of tea in metal holders and retreated softly.</p>
<p>"What do you want to know about Ameri­ca?" Jacob said.</p>
<p>"Everything, I want to know everything. I have a reason, a good reason," Nahum spoke rapidly. "Don't misunderstand me; it's not what you think at all. I am not like the others. I have an idea, a plan."</p>
<p>He looked intently at Jacob's face as if still doubting whether or not to reveal his plan. But even as he was making up his mind they were interrupted. A middle-aged woman came up to their table and held out some small cards. Nahum turned his head away. Jacob took one of the cards. It was printed in Hebrew and German. Kesher Le'echad it said in Hebrew. Arrows on each side of the card pointed up and down. Jacob read the text without comprehending. The woman began speaking rapidly. "Unity is what the world needs. All one, above and be­low, that's what the arrows mean. Electricity. One charge in heaven, one on earth, positive and negative, both drawn toward each other, God and man, male and female, when the two unite there will be peace."</p>
<p>"Give her something," Nahum whispered.</p>
<p>Jacob gave her a coin. She beamed and was about to resume her discourse, but she noticed some other people coming in and went to them.</p>
<p>"If you don't give her something she will abuse you," Nahum said. "She makes up a song on the spot and she'll follow you all the way home and sing it if you don't buy one of her cards."</p>
<p>"She has an idea too."</p>
<p>"You might say so, but I am serious."</p>
<p>"Why do you want to know about America?"</p>
<p>"I want to go there. I am going there."</p>
<p>"Now? While the resistance is on? I had the impression you were involved in it pretty deeply."</p>
<p>"I was. I am. But this plan is different, much bigger."</p>
<p>Jacob waited.</p>
<p>"We are working from the wrong angle," Nahum said after a while. "All this resistance to the British is beside the point. I have thought about it a long time. I am convinced."</p>
<p>"You mean it can't succeed?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't mean that. It can. It is even likely to succeed. But we are working here from the wrong end."</p>
<p>"What is the right end?"</p>
<p>"Germany," Nahum said.</p>
<p>"Germany? And you want to go to Amer­ica? I don't get it."</p>
<p>Nahum quickly glanced about the room. No one was near them.</p>
<p>"Germany, the German people, must be saved," he whispered in a conspiratorial tone. "That's why I want you to tell me about Amer­ica. I will go to America. I have a plan. From America I will save Germany."</p>
<p>"But why should you want to save the Ger­man people—after what they did to you?"</p>
<p>"They must be saved. What we do here doesn't matter much. Now I am convinced of it. We will bomb a few British armored cars. They will kill a few of us. Maybe we will get some sort of autonomy and maybe we won't. The heart of the matter isn't here. Unless the Ger­man people are saved and made to see the light, nothing matters. They will poison the world even more than they have already done."</p>
<p>"And you are going to do it?"</p>
<p>"Why not? I have a plan. It will work. It's got to work. I know it. It's not a new idea, in itself, just the plan, the way of going about it is new. The idea is simple enough. You've heard it a million times. The Germans must be made to repent. Otherwise—do you realize what it means to have eighty million unrepentant mur­derers in the very heart of Europe? What dif­ference will it make whether we get something here from the British if eighty million people in Europe alone remain murderers at heart? Well, ­this much you know yourself. But I have worked out a plan to bring this about, all by myself.</p>
<p>"I will need a little money to carry out my plan, not much, just a little."</p>
<p>"Oh," Jacob sighed, "I see."</p>
<p>"No, you don't. You think it's an alibi, that I want to make money, that I want to ask you for contacts in New York for myself."</p>
<p>"No?"</p>
<p>"No! I don't want anything for myself. But America is important for my plan, for many reasons, and the money I will need will be very little. Just think, the salvation of the entire German people, and that also means the future of the world, and it can be done so easily, so easily that it's laughable."</p>
<p>"How will you go about it?"</p>
<p>"You see, what I need most of all is anonymity, the anonymity of a big city, a metropolis, like New York. Also in New York I am sure I will find a few people who will understand my plan and finance it. Here, the place is too small and everybody is so involved in politics. If. you don't line up with some party you are considered a crank, like that woman who gave you the card.</p>
<p>"I thought you could help me by telling me a little about New York, where the Jews live, if you know anyone who might sympathize with my plan and help finance it, where I could live. It's such a big city and I know nothing about it. I don't understand it. Some call it New York, some talk of Brooklyn and Bronx. They say Brooklyn is New York but New York isn't Brooklyn. I want you to explain these things to me."</p>
<p>Jacob's lips were distorted with a pained smile. "Only the dead know Brooklyn," he said wryly.</p>
<p>"Only the dead? What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, nothing at all. But go on, you haven't told me yet what your plan is, how you will bring our German friends to see the light. It's a pretty big job you are undertaking. Don't forget, the Germans in Germany aren't alone. There are also Ukrainian-speaking Germans in the world, and Magyar-speaking Germans and Lithuanian- and Polish- and even some English-speaking Germans, to mention only a few."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter. I know it. It's contagious."</p>
<p>"What's contagious?" Jacob said in amaze­ment, wondering about the sanity of his companion.	:</p>
<p>"Repentance, redemption, salvation, call it what you wish, they are all contagious, just like their opposites. That's why I believe that unless the Germans are made to repent and to realize the enormity of their guilt, they and the rest of - the world will be lost."</p>
<p>"And your plan?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my plan. You see, I will come to New York and go to live somewhere, quietly, so as not to attract attention. I will get some kind of a job for my own expenses, in a restaurant or in some factory. Nobody—except the few people who will help me—will know what I am doing. When I get some money I will start publishing a small paper."</p>
<p>"And with your small paper you will save the Germans?"</p>
<p>"I will torment them into salvation."</p>
<p>"How will you do that?" Jacob asked, con­vinced that Nahum was not entirely in his right mind. He recalled knowing a printer in New York many years before who had a similar mania. Each month this printer used to publish a minute four-page leaflet lavishly done with three-color illuminated capitals. In it he ex­pressed his opinions on all sorts of subjects in very brief paragraphs. He would print not more than a few hundred copies and scatter them in the streets and in subway trains.</p>
<p>"Memory is the key," Nahum said. "Memory is the key to everything. The Germans don't want to remember what they did. It is essential to prevent them from forgetting. You see what I mean? And this I will do. I will publish a small paper with illustrations, about once a month let us say. 'This you did in Warsaw on such and such a day' I will say and reprint some of the photographs of their atrocities. Each month I will remind them of some incident from the concentration camps, the extermination centers, how they buried people alive, how they experi­mented on Jews as on guinea pigs. There is enough material for many years, and they must be made to remember it all."</p>
<p>"You will need more than a little money to publish eighty million copies."</p>
<p>"I don't need eighty million copies. All I need is a few hundred or perhaps a couple of thousand copies."</p>
<p>"And with a few hundred or even a couple of thousand copies you will refresh the memory of the entire German nation?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's what I meant when I said I would torment them into salvation.</p>
<p>"In New York I will go to the biggest library. There they must have the latest telephone directories and city directories of all German cities and villages. I will take out a few names from each city, alphabetically, not more than one or two under each letter, at random. This will give me a good cross-section of all the Germans. A couple of thousand addresses like these will cover the entire country."</p>
<p>"And then?"</p>
<p>"I will address the envelopes myself and mail them one to a mail box. There must be thousands and thousands of mail boxes in New York. This way the papers will be post-marked in all parts of the city. No one will know where they come from.</p>
<p>"Now you get my point? One day a couple of thousand Germans all over Germany will re­ceive my paper reminding them of their inhu­man crime against the Jews. Maybe a lot of them will not even read it. Some may glance through it and snicker and throw it away. A few will read it through and remember. But the following month I will make up a completely new list, the same way I made up the first one; and more thousands of Germans will receive my paper. The story will break into print. After a few months all the German newspapers, no, all the newspapers in the world, will begin talking about the mysterious reminders that are penetrating into every corner of Germany. Many newspapers may even reprint my small paper.</p>
<p>"Of course it will take time. I have no illu­sions that my plan can be effective in a couple of months. But as time passes, you just wait i and see! At first the Nazis will laugh and throw my paper away. Then they will begin laughing through the other side of their mouths. Because, you see, as my plan develops I will become a shadow behind every German window. Every German will get up in the morning and afraid to look into his mail box for fear that I might be the one to receive one of my illustrate papers. Even though ninety-nine and ninety nine hundredths percent of the Germans don’t receive my paper, each and every one of them will fear that he might be the one to get it. I this way I will bring their extermination came right into their own homes. I will force them to smell the smoke from the crematoria chimneys. I will compel them to look at photographs of the horrors they have committed. I will drive them crazy with memory."</p>
<p>Nahum shook with excitement as he developed his idea.</p>
<p>"I will pursue them with the double-edged sword of remembering. Wherever they go they will feel my eyes on the back of their fat necks. The few thousand who receive my paper may hide it during the day and bury it in deep pits in their back yards at night. Yet they will not escape from it. For I will also send copies to newspapers throughout the world. And besides what, difference will it make after a while, even if the few who receive it read it only behind locked doors? When they go out into the streets everyone, literally everyone, will look suspi­ciously at his neighbor and wonder whether he had received my message that day. I will mail my papers irregularly, sometimes once a month, sometimes I will accumulate a number of issues and mail them at weekly intervals. I will tie their guilt to them as a boy ties a can to a dog's tail, and .. . ."</p>
<p>"And then what?"</p>
<p>"And then, after a long time, of course, a great scream will rise over Germany."</p>
<p>"The scream of their redemption?" Jacob was sarcastic.</p>
<p>"No. Redemption does not come with a scream. It will be a scream of rage, for they will already know their guilt yet refuse to accept it and come to terms with it. They will scream, all of them, because they will feel goaded yet helpless to retaliate or to shut out the persistent voice. They will be like a scorpion within a ring of flame.</p>
<p>"I, Nahum Steinman, will insinuate my voice of remembrance into every German mind and they will be helpless against me." He laughed weirdly as he said this.</p>
<p>"Of course, I know, it will be a dangerous job, for when the millions of Germans are driven into helpless fury they will try to crush the instigator of their torment. They will try hard to find out who I am. No doubt they have many agents in New York. That's why I have to do this work from New York, because it is a huge city and I can get lost in it easily. I am sure they will never find me in New York."</p>
<p>"And then?"</p>
<p>"And then? Then the world see results. After a fury of desperate efforts to shake loose the torment of memory which I will have inflicted upon the Germans, they will gradually become reconciled to my reminders. They will not yet be saved. That will take much longer. But they will stop fighting me. They will read my paper. And a strange thing will happen. They will be­come anxious to read it. Now they will want to read about the horrors they committed, just as previously they tried hard not to hear of them. Copies of my paper will pass from hand to hand. Germans meeting one another in the street will anxiously ask each other whether a new copy had not arrived, and they will beg for old copies which they have missed. They will organize read­ing circles, from the Rhine to the Oder, and beyond, in every German town and village there will be groups meeting regularly to read my paper. They will discuss it. They will study the photographs I will publish, every minute part of them. Since I will publish so few copies, the Germans will besiege their newspapers and magazines with demands for reprints of my small paper. And now a great cry will rise over Germany."</p>
<p>"A cry? Earlier it was a scream."</p>
<p>"You  are laughing at me?" Nahum said, taken aback.</p>
<p>"No, I am only trying to understand you," Jacob said dolefully.</p>
<p>"Yes, a cry," Nahum said. "But now it will be different. Now it will be a cry for more knowledge. 'Let us have more information,' the Germans will cry. 'We want to know every­thing, everything. We want to see pictures of all the men and the women and the children whom we have destroyed so cruelly. We want to see photographs of every monstrosity we have committed.'</p>
<p>"There will be no satiating their eagerness to know. They will seek out those among them who had a direct part in the extermination of the Jews, and they will question them minutely; not in courts, but each German for himself and in small groups. For at this stage the Germans will already tend to gather in groups, afraid to be alone with their consciences, although, of course, they will not yet understand clearly why they want to flock together. 'Tell us,' they will say to the attendant of some gas chamber, 'when they brought out the dead bodies and it was your job to knock out the gold fillings from the teeth of the fresh corpses, what were their faces like? Did they show much suffering? Tell us about each one. Don't skip a single one. We want to know.' "</p>
<p>"And this will be their salvation?" Jacob asked.	.</p>
<p>"No," Nahum said. "Not yet. The final salvation will come later. This will still be a preliminary stage. In true Teutonic fashion they will still be factual and efficient about it. Merely a matter of gathering all the information avail­able. Though, within their hearts, salvation will have begun, for salvation begins with knowledge and knowledge means memory.</p>
<p>"And at this stage," Nahum continued, "I will become a person much sought after. But now they will no longer hunt me to kill me and to still my voice. Now they will look for me to learn more. But I will remain anonymous. I will always remain anonymous. The Germans will try to reach me. In newspapers throughout the world, and of course in every paper in New York, there will appear big advertisements which will read something as follows: 'We appeal to you, unknown author of our memory, please identify yourself. No harm will befall you. We want to know who you are. We want you to tell us more: We confess that there was a time when we wanted to destroy you. But you need fear us no more. We, the German people, guarantee your safety.'"</p>
<p>"And you will refuse of course."</p>
<p>"Naturally."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"The time will not be ripe yet. Were I to reveal my identity at this point, my whole work might be undone. If the world were to see me as I am, an average human being, perhaps un­shaven, perhaps suffering from a head cold, perhaps a mere dishwasher in some dreary little restaurant, all my work might collapse. Later, when my work is finished, I may identify my­self. It won't matter any more. I probably won't matter any more. I probably won't be believed. 'No, it couldn't have been you who brought about our redemption,' they will say.</p>
<p>"But I will continue publishing my paper, because everything depends on it. Even at this late stage of the transformation of the Germans the effects of my work might be lost if I were to stop prodding them.</p>
<p>"Then there will come the time when they will finally be satiated. They will want no more knowledge. They will know all. Every German will know everything in his heart and then their true salvation will begin."</p>
<p>"I suppose they will start shouting in unison: mea culpa."</p>
<p>"No. They won't do that. That won't be necessary any more. They will feel their guilt, but they will feel it so keenly that it won't be necessary to talk about it. Instead they will act on it."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Not all at once. It will begin slowly. They will begin hanging on their walls the photo­graphs of their crimes. They will make it a practice to read one of my leaflets regularly, as a matter of duty, every day, if only for a few minutes. In time they will start making pil­grimages to Dachau and Treblinka and all the other places where they performed their hor­rors. They will not be able to explain just why they do it. But the number of pilgrims to these places will keep growing. All their attitudes will change. If a German child will hit another one, he will not be beaten for it. Instead all the other children will shun the culprit because he had done something which 'a German must never do again.' Any sign of violence in Germany will not only be condemned; it will be looked upon with horror, because it will resemble, be it ever so little, 'the thing' of which they are guilty. A new unwritten commandment will go into ef­fect, with much more compulsion behind it than any written law. It will be hard to define it, because it will be based on a great revulsion against anything that in any way resembles the great crime."</p>
<p>"You mean they will reject violence and ag­gression against weaker ones?"</p>
<p>"It will be much more than that. You know the Western revulsion to incest? Well, that will be as nothing compared with the German re­vulsion against violence. It will be much, much more than that. Let me try to describe it to you. If a German will cause some hurt to someone, even accidentally, he will come to the injured party and say: 'I have committed the thing which must not be done. I cannot forgive myself. You cannot forgive me either. Because there is no forgiveness for a thing like that. I would gladly kill myself in atonement. But I must not, be­cause there is no atonement for what I did. Henceforth I will go about an outcast. Every­body, will want to forgive me because the hurt I caused was trivial and was inflicted accidentally, but I can never forgive myself nor can I accept forgiveness. I must cast myself out for­ever from human society."</p>
<p>"I think I know what you mean," Jacob said, " and what will happen after that?"</p>
<p>"After that? After that a moan. will rise over Germany, a moan of contrition that will hang over the country like a halo. They will no longer wish to escape memory. That will be far behind them. They will no longer even remember. They will live their guilt instead of remembering it. And they will establish shrines. They will make shrines out of the former extermination centers, and each year every German, together with his whole family, will feel duty-bound to visit one of these shrines. Perhaps they won't do anything there, just come and look and depart again, to return the following year. And perhaps they will do something else. They will invite Jews to come to visit Germany. 'Come and honor us with your presence,' they will say. 'We don't care who you are. Send us your criminals at least, for even they will consecrate our ground by treading on it because they are related in some way to the ones to whose ashes we make pilgrimages.' And in the middle of Berlin they will set aside an area—not only in Berlin, in every big city and in every town—that will be known as the 'black spot.' "</p>
<p>"What will be there?"</p>
<p>"Nothing will be there. It will be a symbol of their former defilement. It may only be a few square yards in size, and it will be barred with chains, and they will come to look at it, as a reminder. And when they look at it they will say, II came here to be reminded of the peo­ple we gassed and burned and tortured to death, of the people we crucified, of the people crucified.'"</p>
<p>Jacob trembled. This was the very same for­mula that had come to his mind that faraway night when he lay drunk on a bench in Wash­ington Square, the night before the war broke out.</p>
<p>"The people crucified!" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Yes. What's wrong with that? What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Go on."</p>
<p>"That's all. I've talked too much as it is," Nahum said. "Now tell me about New York. That's what I brought you here for."</p>
<p>"I can tell you little. I am myself almost a stranger in New York."</p>
<p>Nahum looked at him with mistrust. "Oh, I see, you don't understand my plan. You don't believe it will work."</p>
<p>"I do understand it. The old story. Another Jesus, a collective Jesus this time. The first myth worked, why not another one just like it?"</p>
<p>Jacob felt very tired. It had grown dark outside.</p>
<p>"I am sorry. I can't help you. The plan is all right, but you picked the wrong person. I am really and genuinely sorry."</p>
<p>Nahum didn't answer. They rose to go.</p>
<p>Near the door the middle-aged woman was still talking to some people. She cheerfully waved to Jacob. Kesher Le'echad, she called to him, as if the phrase were a password between them.</p>
<p>Outside they parted without another word.</p>
