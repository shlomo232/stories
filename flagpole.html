    <h1>The Flagpole Sitter</h1><p>The press did not report the event. And rightly so--it wasn't much of an event. In a city like New York such things are not uncommon, and one learns not to notice them unless some special circumstances draw attention to them.</p>
<p>The neighborhood had been partly industrial and generally run down for a good many years. More recently it was mostly abandoned and generally shunned. So what if in its midst there stood one structure taller than the rest, ten stories high, once housing a variety of small industrial enter­prises, which had long ago moved elsewhere? Its windows were encrusted with thick layers of sediment of a big city's pollution. It's true that in a couple of windows on the ground floor a light was usually seen in the evening. The few who did notice this no doubt concluded that some squatters had moved in and gave the matter no further thought. And on the roof of this structure there was a flagpole, and near the top of the pole there was some kind of flimsy construction resembling a crow's nest on the mast of an old-fashioned sailing ship.</p>
<p>But a couple of years ago, around the middle Seventies, the City Fathers decided to tear down this blighted neighborhood which marred an otherwise desirable residential location and to build a new housing devel­opment on the site. And thus it came about that one Monday morning a crew of house wreckers equipped with the tools of their trade and headed by a foreman carrying all sorts of blueprints drove up to this building in a couple of trucks. They tried the large front doors but the locks, unopened for many years, refused to yield. Then they walked to the rear of the building. Two windows, cleaned and curtained on the inside, faced them, and the adjoining door had a bell which they rang.</p>
<p>An aged woman opened the door and the foreman explained to her the purpose of his mission.</p>
<p>"You can't tear down this building," she told him firmly. "Why can't we?"</p>
<p>"Come, and I'll show you why," she said, and started up the stairs. The wreckers and a few kids and some older people who had stopped to watch when the trucks pulled up, followed her. They mounted the nine flights and emerged on the roof. There the woman pointed to the rickety shack clinging to the flagpole. "See there?" she said. "My husband is there."</p>
<p>The foreman scratched his balding skull. "I'll be a son of a . . . How long has he been sitting there? Hey you, up there, come on down. We got to tear this building down. How long did you say he's been up there?" he again asked the woman.</p>
<p>"A long time," she answered quietly. "Let's see, it was in the late twenties, in 1927, many did it then, all over the country. You wouldn't remember. It was before you were born.".</p>
<p>"And then what happened?" the foreman asked.</p>
<p>"Lindy," she said.</p>
<p>"Lindy?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Lindy. Charles Lindbergh. He flew across the Atlantic. Became a hero, and caught the public fancy. So everybody forgot the flag­pole sitters and they all came down. All except my husband."</p>
<p>"Sitting on top of the flagpole for fifty years?" the foreman said in disbelief.</p>
<p>"My husband is a man of principle," was all the woman said in reply.</p>
<p>The foreman was silent a while. The youngsters now took over. "Hey, how's the weather up there?" one of them called. Another began singing What Shall We Do With the Flagpole Sitter to the tune of "What Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor."</p>
<p>The woman now spoke. "My husband is not like other men. He climbed up there not because it was a fad, or to get publicity. He went up there to prove something, to stay there as long as he could. Well, he's still there proving his conviction. It would kill him if you now forced him down."</p>
<p>"Look, lady," the foreman pleaded. "We got to start tearing this building down now. That's our job. Your husband can find himself another flagpole on top of some other building, taller than this one. Hey, Mister," he called to the flagpole sitter, "come on down and we'll find you another flagpole, a better one."</p>
<p>The flagpole sitter did not answer, but the woman replied instead. "You don't understand. This is the flagpole he ascended fifty years ago. And on this one he has to prove himself. If you force him down before he is himself ready to come down, it will kill him," she repeated her warning.</p>
<p>The foreman thought a long while. He did not understand. But he was not an unkind man. "All right fellows, let's go," he said, and the small crowd filed down the stairs. Back at the office of the wrecking company he made his report, and it was passed on to the appropriate city authorities.</p>
<p>City Fathers did not win this title without reason. When the report about the flagpole sitter reached them they too were baffled for a while but finally decided to spare this building. They would proclaim it some sort of historical site, they concluded. There were also some unspoken considerations. It's New York, after all. Who is to say how many unnoticed men of principle are sitting on all kinds of flagpoles in such a huge metropolis? Many might even be carrying their flagpoles on their backs or in their heads. Comes election time—well, its wiser to play safe.</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>The new housing development has been completed some time ago. In its midst still stands the old, abandoned, and grimy factory building. Flower beds now border its walls. At first the new tenants were puzzled by it. Then they lost interest and came to accept it as simply "one of those things." Visitors from out of town on guided tours sometimes stop to wonder at the incongruity of it. They are then told by their uniformed guide: "See that crow's nest on top of the mast on the roof? Our flagpole sitter is there. A dedicated man of principle. And now Ladies and Gentlemen, let's get back to the bus. Our next stop will be the world famous . . . "</p>
