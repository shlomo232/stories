    <h1>Reprieve</h1>
    <p>"Thirty days before a person dies, he's notified from Heaven," my father said to me. "Thus it is written in the holy books."</p>
<p>"How do they let him know?" I asked.</p>
<p>"There is no one particular way," he answered. "But there is never any mistaking it: Sometimes it is done in a dream. Or a person simply gets up in the morning and feels it in his bones that his end is about to come. He just knows that he will die. Another time one's face suddenly undergoes a peculiar change. The nose becomes sharpened, or the expression in the eyes changes. Or a mark may appear on the face, some strange small mark on the forehead that cannot be accounted for. Other people may also notice the change and understand what it means. But the person thus noti­fied always understands."</p>
<p>"Why do they do it, from Heaven, I mean? Wouldn't it be better not to let a person know? This way he must worry a lot."</p>
<p>My father looked at me sternly. What was this? Rebellion against the ways of Heaven?</p>
<p>"It's so one should repent and mend his ways," he answered briefly.</p>
<p>This bit of information came to me at just the right psychological moment. I was eight years old. Almost up to that day, death was a remote fact that was not likely to affect either me or my family. Of course, I knew about death. I knew that everyone was doomed to die and that I, too, would die some day. But despite this knowledge, I was convinced that death was something decreed for others. The obvious contradiction did not lessen my certainty.</p>
<p>I also knew that death was terrible beyond all other terrors. I had seen dead animals, cats, dogs, even the carcasses of horses, their open mouths absurdly yawning at the sky, flies crawling over their exposed teeth. With people, I knew, it was still worse. When a person died they scooped a hole in the ground, tossed him in and shovelled the earth back over him.</p>
<p>A person would not even be left out in the open, as a cat or a dog. Yet, being in the open-was so very important. As long as one was above ground, on the ground, one was still a part of life through association with the living.</p>
<p>Then the unbelievable happened and death struck. Two grandparents died and the impossible became possible. As long as they lived, I was two generations removed from death. Now, all of a sudden, only my parents stood between me and "it." The Angel of Death was so awfully close. That the angel followed an ordinal sequence in his visits I did not doubt. First, the old went; then the ones next to them, and so on. Of course, I knew that children also died. I remembered the death of a neighbor's infant. The day he was buried it had rained, and when sunset came, the clouds were such a terrifying orange-green. But that could happen to other children belong to other families. We--my family and I--were exempt.</p>
<p>This bit of ancient lore that my father revealed to me, as part of his constant effort to broaden my education, seemed to sink into my mind without leaving a trace. But it was not lost. It was only planted deeply. It bore its first fruit, some weeks later, when I had a dream.</p>
<p>I dreamed that I was dead. I lay stretched on the bed, still, unable to move. It was night also in my dream, and no one noticed what had happened to me. I wished: that someone would wake up and see my pre­dicament before it was too late. Perhaps, being adults, they could do something about it, bring me back to life, somehow. But the family slept while I lay dead hour after hour. Then morning came, the sun rose and they discovered me. There was such a to-do, crying and wailing and all the rest of it. But it was too late, and they knew it, for in the midst of their tears and protests to Heaven, they proceeded to do to me what was necessary. They took me off the bed and put me on the floor. Then they spread something over me, a sheet or a blanket, and pulled it over my face. This last measure was too much for me. It was the final counter-signature of the permanence of my death, and, summoning all my strength to protest it, I awoke.</p>
<p>Outside, a gray March morning drizzled forlornly. The sky seemed to have caved in overnight, and pieces of its tattered firmament hung low over the roofs dripping some of the waters above.</p>
<p>I looked at the cracked grey clouds and felt disconsolate. This was it. I had been notified from Heaven. I did not feel bitter. There was only resignation tinged with terror. It was impossible to misinter­pret the omen of the dream. All that remained was to count the succession of thirty days, and then . . .</p>
<p>I got out of bed and began the day's routine, but my heart dragged wearily within me. If it were only possible to stop living right away. What difference did one more month make, when I knew, without a doubt, that it was the last one? It would also be easier just to sit and wait for it to. come. Otherwise, each moment of joy would be countered with a reactive pang of realization of the true state of affairs. For an instant, I thought of telling the family of my predicament, and just as quickly rejected the idea. They were helpless in the face of the sentence passed on me. Their intentions were excellent, but futile. This I had learned from experience., How many times, during childhood, when they had to take me to a doctor, did they cheerfully assure me that it would be pain­less? And then, it was not painless at all. I had lost faith in their promises. This was bad enough when I was smaller, and only a visit to the doctor was involved. Now it was out of the question to play the game. This was serious. They would try to distract me, to make me think that the dream was meaningless. I would have to pretend that I believed them. Yet, the thought of cheerful pretense was inadmissible. I had to face it myself. Any digression would only be a painful waste. I had no time for digressions. I had to concentrate on what was before me.</p>
<p>I said nothing to anyone and moped alone in the desert patch, which my soul had become overnight. Better this way, better be alone with my terrible secret. Anything was preferable to the insincere consolation which was the best that others could give me.</p>
<p>"Don't you feel well?" mother asked, as I listlessly dragged about the house.</p>
<p>"No, I am fine," I said.</p>
<p>But the food would not go down, and in desperation, I grabbed my books and lunch and ran off to school.</p>
<p>The wall that had arisen between me, the doomed one, and all the others, excluded all thoughts except those pertaining to the main theme. Thirty days, and then they would take my body and bury it. But my body, that is I; they would bury me. For some time, I battled this problem, trying to disengage my identity as a person from my body as a physical unit. The results of the struggle were indifferent. One moment, the sundering was accomplished, and the prospect did not loom so terrible. My soul would not die; I would not die. This way I might even be able to participate in the drama of my funeral as the main hero, while also remain­ing a spectator. But the following moment this formulation, so laboriously constructed, would collapse under an avalanche of despair, and my body and I would again become one, indivisible, consigned to be covered with a cloth, carried to the cemetery which I had never seen, dropped into a pit, covered with earth, and then--then everyone else would go home and eat dinner, but I would remain alone, buried, rigid, unable even to scream my fear. All this would happen in thirty days. But a month after that, even my body would no longer be a body and would . . .</p>
<p>There my mind would stop, and I had to begin all over again. We are people; we are Jews; we believe in God; we have souls; we believe in the hereafter and the resurrection of the dead. On second thought, if the hereafter was such a wonderful place--after the sins were atoned for that good men ate of the Leviathan and drank the wine preserved from the sixth day of Creation, why did God ordain resurrection into this world? Didn't it mean that this world, and this body, and the things we did here were really better than the hereafter? After the entire body rots away, there remains one small bone somewhere in the neck and it is called Luz, and this little bone serves as a sort of seed from which the entire body sprouts again and comes back to life. My father told me this. So that when they take my body, thirty days from now, and they bury it, it will really be me, all of me, because without the little bone, called Luz, even my soul could not participate in the resurrection, and the little bone was in my neck.</p>
<p>The day dragged interminably. Would all thirty of them be like this, How would I survive such a month? Why wasn't this the twenty-ninth day, or, better still, thirty-one days after my dream, so that everything was over and done with and the new existence begun?</p>
<p>I scanned the faces of other people I met, for signs of similar doom. Some of them were old, and their faces were yellowish and wrinkled and cadaverous, but they did not bear the stamp I looked for. Even if I had seen any tell-tale marks on their faces, I would not have been greatly cheered. They were old, old. It was right and natural that they should receive their summonses. But I was eight, only eights That my family, which I had always believed immune to death, should be stricken such a double blow—being subject to death, and at such a young age—was at first inexplicable. It must be a punishment for some great sin. Considering that I was the one chosen to be called away, I must be the sinner. Hadn't father told me that the thirty days of grace were given for repentance?</p>
<p>The day dragged on in. misery. The thoughts of the morning hours, by now tangled beyond all hope of unraveling,, pressed on my heart and I surrendered to their incoherent weight. This, too, I would have to bear for the next thirty days. Then came evening and added its share of gloom. My protestations that I was in good health was disbelieved and after a casual test of my temperature, by the simple method of laying a hand on my forehead, I was sent off to bed. Exhausted, I fell asleep almost at once, and slept through the night without receiving any follow-ups on the first summons. I awoke to the dreary realization that only twenty-nine days were left to one on earth. But having rested, and feeling a great resigna­tion verging on indifference, the prospect was no longer as terrifying as on the preceding day.</p>
<p>Day followed day, and the knowledge of doom brooded in my mind. Yet, as the days passed, this awareness receded somewhat. After a little more than a week had passed and I took stock of my remaining time among the living, I was appalled to realize that I was not quite sure whether nine or ten days had elapsed. This worried me for a while, then I adjusted with remarkable ease to the thought that I had either twenty or twenty-one days to go. At the end of three weeks the margin of error was considerably greater.</p>
<p>Things were happening. Spring was coming on fast. The weather set in fair and warm. The grass was sprouting underfoot. Games were wild and exuberant. Who could spare time to thoughts of death when every minute was brimming with life? The knowledge was there, in the back of my head, but it was dozing. The spring holidays were approaching. Home was in tur­moil. There were matzoh in the house. The Passover dishes had been brought down. They mustn't be touched yet. But their promise could be admired from a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>And just as suddenly as it came, the terror vanished. I awoke one morning and began to reckon my remaining time, and a great light broke around me. The thirty days had long since passed. I was not sure exactly how many more had gone by, but I knew that it was at least a week after the appointed time. I leaped out of bed. I had no weight. Life was wonder­ful, marvelous. I had been reprieved, indefinitely.</p>
<p>I must have misunderstood the dream, I said to myself. Yet it had seemed so clear. Now I was sure of one thing: even if I were to receive the true summons the following night, I would have at least another thirty days to go. The sacred books were right--that I did not doubt. But my fate had been postponed-some other time, some other time. And who knows? Maybe never, as I had always believed.</p>
<p>Half realized, there was still another consolation hidden in that bright spring morning. Supposing, just supposing that when the true sum­mons comes I brush it off as a false sign? Since I was wrong when the omen seemed so convincing, why couldn't I doubt the real announcement? Surely it could not.be more convincing than the one I had just had?</p>
<p>Then I would never, never know, and death, if it must come, endless aeons away, would steal up unannounced, unheralded.	</p>
