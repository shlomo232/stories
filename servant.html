    <h1>My Servant Jacob</h1>
<p class=topnote>"My Servant Jacob" is the opening part of a chapter from a novel in progress. The action in this chapter takes place on the day preceding the outbreak of World War II. Other sections of this work have appeared in this magazine in the Spring of 1956 ("Section Eight") and the Summer of 1959 ("The Failure of Compassion")</p>

<p class=ital>God said to Jacob, Fear not my servant Jacob.</p>
<p>ALTHOUGH he had been anxious to leave for some time, Jacob found it difficult to bid his parents the usual farewells. He was paying them his weekly visit which had become a regular institution in his and their lives ever since he left home in the Bronx four years earlier and moved to a furnished room downtown. At the time, moving downtown was a declaration of independence and a proclamation of maturity on his part, and it coincided with two other drastic steps he took—he dropped out of college and formally joined the recently established League for Revo­lutionary Action (Left) . Unconfessed to himself, he harbored many hopes and dreams to be realized in his new independent status. Ile would really LIVE, he promised himself, now that he was cutting the umbilical cord that tied him to his family and his past. He would be on his own, self-supporting, for one thing. And this part of his program he quickly realized, out of necessity, when he got himself a job as a clerk in a mail order house. But, most important, lie would live as a political man, an active member of a revolutionary party which had a scientific plan to rebuild society from the bottom up; and also as a man, as a grown adult male. This latter aspect of the future lacked a scientific plan and Jacob feared to think concretely about it. Of course, there would be women and love and sex, casual relationships and serious involvements, but all this would happen in time, and of itself, and it must not be rushed, but rather contemplated from a distance until the chosen moment should crash upon him in triumph.</p>
<p>The main thing—the main thing was to make a break with the past. This was essential if he was to become a part of "history in the making," as Jacob thought of his new life. There were moments, it is true, when Jacob had his doubts about the meaning of his urgent desire for a break with his past, and he wondered whether factors less than historic did not lie behind his wish to leave his family. Was it necessary, he ques­tioned himself at such moments of honesty, to leave home in order to join The League for Revolutionary Action (Left)? Couldn't he be as active living at home with his parents? More so perhaps, for then he would not have to take a job and could devote more time to his political activities, or, if he took a job, he would not have to spend so much on rent and could contribute more of his income to the Cause. And as far as living by himself in a furnished room downtown, he was quite sure that it was simply a matter of now being grown up, but he also wondered sometimes whether his dreams of love and women and sex did not play a more important part in his decision than he cared to acknowledge. For Jacob conceived of every potential situation as a problem on many levels. There was the higher level of love and mature relationship with women, of course; but then, too, there was the lower level of practical convenience of whose absurdity he was also conscious. From his reading of revolution­ary literature Jacob knew exactly how one makes a revolution. It was really quite simple. The masses are discontented and one proceeds to organize a revolutionary cadre, a small, disciplined group of devoted leaders. He would be one of these. Then, when the historic moment comes, as during a period of severe unemployment or at the end of a disastrous war, one organizes strikes. These strikes spread and give way to street demonstrations and riots. The slogans are simple enough. They could be Bread and Peace, or 'Work and Peace, or Give Us Back Our Sons, or anything like this, and then the cadres go into action. City Hall is taken, Pennsylvania Station is seized. A provisional revolutionary committee is set up. A call is broadcast throughout the country to set up similar revolu­tionary councils. A mass overflow rally is held in Madison Square Garden. A leader of the Revolutionary Council, one of the cadres—it might even be Jacob himself, though he was still too modest to cast himself in this role and was satisfied merely to sit on the stage—addresses the audience and formulates the slogans, the crowd cheers approval, the speaker is elected president of the council by acclamation. Then one convokes a continental congress of revolutionary councils which automatically approves what happened before and ok's the membership of the national revolu­tionary council. After that it is simple. A new revolutionary army is organized. All industries are nationalized. A few hundred reactionaries are shot, another few thousand are imprisoned, and that's all there is to it. Of course, Jacob knew that he still had to learn much about the theory of revolution, but so far as the practice was concerned, everything was clear in his mind. It should also be mentioned that sonic years before, when lie was still in high school, lie had undergone a period of depression when the coining of the revolution and the new dawn palled on him and he could not visualize a red flag on a flagpole except as hanging limply and dripping with rain. But that was a temporary mood which passed after a few months. Probably clue to some adolescent glandular disturbance, Jacob later explained it away with youthful pseudo-scientific cynicism.</p>
<p>But where love was concerned it was exactly the reverse. He thought he knew everything there was to know about the theory of sexual love, but practice was a different matter. He had read many novels and he read much of Freud and surreptitiously also handbooks on married life, and the rest of his theoretical knowledge was completed by many hours of fancying and day-dreaming which occupied much of his free time and, to his self-disgust, invaded even the hours that were set aside for more important matters. Many a time he scolded himself when during meet­ings at which important revolutionary matters were discussed he found thoughts of love forcing themselves into his mind, wilfully, irresistibly, and later, after the meetings, when together with some friends lie con­tinued the discussion on a more intimate level, these thoughts would still persist, and he was anxious to talk about these matters with his friends but was ashamed to because . . . because, of course, history, and the League for Revolutionary Action, and his role in history and similar matters were ever so much more important than personal desires and lusts and fancies and he was afraid that if he were to switch the subject to what troubled him most, love making, his friends might jeer at him and call him a pampered bourgeois baby who was more interested in his own pleasures than in the fate of the working class and society. And in any case, what was there to talk about? One wanted sex so one went ahead and took it wherever one could; it was no problem at all, to them, they would say. Thus it seemed to Jacob that they would scoff at him, and he refrained from dis­cussing the subject that was uppermost in his mind, or at least as prom­inent as any other, though he would not confess it. And so, when the time came, and he was nineteen, he made the drastic decision and left home and college and moved to a room in a furnished rooming-house down­town, and though he talked of being independent and on his own, a revolutionary young worker-intellectual trying to find his appropriate place in the historic process, an active organization man not encumbered by past or by duties to parents whose presence annoyed him, he was never­theless aware that there were still other, unadmitted because ashamed of, reckonings in his plans and that these had nothing to do with revolution or the League for Revolutionary Action, and were concerned mainly with love and love making; for he knew. the time was hound to come, and soon at that—it had to be soon—when if only as a matter of asserting his status as a grown up, independent, historical materialist who shunned false bourgeois prejudices and middle class sentimentality he would have to face this fact too, the elusive, much desired yet feared fact of lovemak­ing, and the time would come when he would have to say to her, "Let's go up to my place," or something of the sort, and of course it would have to be said casually, ever so casually, as if it were a matter of routine and something that he had said many times before, and the answer too would be a foregone conclusion, as a matter of historical materialism, if for no other reason, and it didn't really matter, he thought, to whom he would extend this invitation, for as a revolutionist who had left the fleshpots of the Bronx he was bound to be devoid of sentimentality, and sex, as he thought he believed and outwardly maintained, was a secondary matter, a purely physical function, to which devoted revolutionists paid little atten­tion, except that, of course, it was, regrettably, a need not to be denied, the way one needed food, and also shelter perhaps—but who at nineteen, with history beckoning, paid any attention to food, except to gulp down something quickly in order to be ready for higher matters?</p>
<p>Thus, though she was still faceless and nameless, hardly more than a compelling dream and a recurring fever, she figured prominently in his stubborn decision to leave home and move downtown. Tn his heart he knew that it was so though he felt he would rather die than admit it to others, and he knew also, though this he would not admit even to himself, that this aspect of his declaration of independence and of his exodus from home was more compelling than all the other avowed reasons. And why indeed should she have a distinct face or an individual name when she was not one, could not be one, and her face was the combined face of all as well as the separate face of each, and her name was legion? But faceless and nameless as she still was, Jacob knew that he had a date with her, an undefined date so far as time was concerned but one that, he thrilled, would have to be kept, even as he thrilled with the knowledge that he had another appointment, different yet no less urgent, with history, which he was not free to ignore. He was sure lie knew where and how history was made and that he could find his way to it and his place in it; but she, the nameless one whom he was awaiting and who no doubt awaited him somewhere in the tangled undergrowth of the city, when the time came to take her by the hand and lead her to the longed-for moment, where would he take her? Oh, the absurdity of it, the ridiculous, dishonest, shameful absurdity of making detailed preparations for the unknown. He winced even as he made his preparations, but secretly his heart was determined—when history, his own personal history was to come knocking on his door, it would find a door to knock on, and a room to enter, and a couch to lie on.</p>
<p>"I do-o-on't want to make history/I just want to make love." The hateful tune reverberated in his head. Traitor! Confess! You are a traitor, aren't you? Just a petty bourgeois milksop dreaming of a girl in bed, a poor working girl, perhaps, to be seduced and abandoned, and for the sake of the fulfillment of such salacious dreams you build up an entire revolu­tionary rationale about rejecting the past and leaving home and devoting yourself to the Cause and all that, and yet all you are is a pimply boy afraid of his parents' disapproval, a voyeur pecking at his own fancies and then pretending lie is looking at something else altogether. Shame! Shame! Shame! Just a calculating plotter. That was the worst of it. That was the betrayal, for calculation of any material sort, was that not the very trade­mark of those bourgeois values from which he pretended to flee? No, no, no, he reassured himself. History and love, History Is Love, the great revolu­tionary orgasm beside which all else pales, the great love of mankind and the working class, under the leadership of the League for Revolutionary Action. There is no individual and there is no Jacob, only a minute part of the people, a minute part of the working class, and in the fulfillment of the great love for all, there would also come the fulfillment of the individual love, inevitably, in the red glory of the new freedom, and in any case, this too had to be shed and broken with, this constant, sickly introspection, a part of the indecision and insecurity that afflicted the members of the doomed social class to which he belonged and from which he was breaking away when leaving home. In the crucible of the future his individual dreams of love would fuse with the irresistible desire of society to be re­newed. He was not calculating; no, no, not at all, he was simply moving forward, rushing forward to meet the inevitable—the desired, the feared, the loved, the so terribly-wanted inevitable.</p>
<p>Thus he felt guilty and chastised himself for it. It was not fitting for a young revolutionist to be so concerned with his personal interests, and most particularly was it a breach of the code to be false about it. Falseness was a trait of the society from which he was breaking away. Yet could he deny that he was being dishonest about the matter of moving downtown and away from home? That among other things he also simply wished to avoid the questioning glances each morning after he had returned home just before dawn, and the unvoiced condemnation of his unorthodox be­havior? Or that perhaps if his family did not so fervently though silently demand his allegiance to its own history, it might not at all be necessary to move away from them? In short, he suspected that he was also rejecting and abandoning them at the same time that he was hatching his secret plots.</p>
<p>And as far as she was concerned, lie also knew that he was not really honest with himself, and that she was not nearly so faceless as he pretended to believe, that in fact she had a very distinct swarthy skin, black eyes and hair, and a moonlike face which despite the vividness of her complexion somehow seemed lacking in expression, a face that smiled vaguely and complacently at nearly everything that was said to her or in her presence, wearing the smile as a veil, so that neither Jacob, nor any of the other members of the League to which she too belonged, really knew what hid behind this veil, whether great intuitive wisdom exceeding all their youthful knowledge and theories, or merely a silent void. They tried to find out, jokingly, condescendingly, but very earnestly too, for it was terribly im­portant for them to know.</p>
<p>Nor was she nameless, and often Jacob winced when he thought of her name. Rose. Of all things, Rose; and this was a great injustice for which he would have blamed God himself, had he at this stage acknowl­edged the existence of God. Was a more impossible name conceivable for her, he raged in secret. And why, when all the members of the League changed their family names in good conspiratorial revolutionary fashion, and some of them also changed their first names, why didn't she change hers to—almost anything else would have been better. Was that a clue perhaps, was that the answer to her character and nature? Did that prove that behind her tantalizing vague smile there really was a blank?</p>
<p>She was a mystery, and Jacob was not the only one to be intrigued by it. Other young members of the League, more forward than he, tried to solve the riddle and many times, when the speaker at the meeting of their League branch had concluded his oration and almost everyone in the group was engaged in heated debate, they would try to tease Rose into participating in the discussions, for she, who had patiently listened to all that was said, never asked a question of the speaker. nor took the floor in the debates that followed. Her glowing face, her black eyes dancing with what seemed to be inner fire, the ecstatic smile playing on her lips made them suspect that she was more in tune with the spirit of the idea discussed than any of the others, that she somehow understood everything more thoroughly than words could convey. But whenever someone in the group called on her to speak out, to give her opinion, she would look coyly about herself, the smile would spread from her lips over her entire face, the light in her eyes would change from earnestness to flirtation and she would wave her hand lightly and say, "Oh, g'wan, you're kidding!" And it was not clear what she meant by this. The others rashly concluded that Rose simply had noth­ing to contribute to the discussion. But not Jacob. Not he. He could not, he would not permit himself to dismiss her so easily, though his heart ached with suspicion: Could the others be right? For though he did not know it, he was already deeply in love with her, and it was for her sake that he was moving away from his parents, and it was she to whom he would one day say, "Let's go up to my place," and it was for her that he needed a door to unlock and a room to enter and then to close the door behind them and to be apart from the world and from history. Then, too, Jacob heard things that the others didn't and knew truths that the others were not aware of, and when Rose would say, "G'wan, you're kidding," he heard much more in this remark than was immediately apparent, for though at first impression it might have appeared to be only an insipid remark, foolish, socially retrogressive, reactionary in fact, the kind of thing which a petty-bourgeois girl from a lower middle class family in the Bronx would say, implying by its words and intonation that, well, you boys and I, we understand each other, for you are here to pick up a girl and never mind your highfalutin' talk about revolution and dialectics and economics and all that, and I am here to look over the field because, well, a girl has got to be on the lookout for Mr. Right, doesn't she, and if I spot someone I think is solid I won't be taken in by all the fancy talk, not me, and I'll know when the right number comes along, so really, you are just kidding, asking my opinion about things that I don't care a damn about and am not interested in, especially when I know you, I know what you are, and you are not interested in all this big talk either, so we understand each other, and all I can do, and this is the right thing to do, is smile, letting you know that I know what you're after, and I know you know what I am after, and all this business of lectures and discussions and arguments is just so much baloney concealing our real intentions and that's why I say G'wan you're kidding, but just as soon as Mr. Right comes along I'll have plenty to say and it won't be at a meeting and it won't have anything to do with recon­structing society and the class stria -le and why somebody over in Europe had the right idea or the wrong idea in his book, for when Mr. Right and the right moment come along I'll say plenty and it will be said privately and it will have to do with marriage and with an apartment and furniture and the kind of wedding we are going to have and who will be invited and the kind of car we will buy, and how much my parents will put up and all that. And I will also give out plenty—I am not the kind to hold back and, believe me, I got plenty to give, as you boys can see for yourselves, and there is a chance for the right party at the right time, but all the same don't any of you think that because of all this radical talk you can get very far with me unless you mean business. So that's why I say, "G'wan, you're kidding."</p>
<p>And, indeed, this is how most of the others understood it and con­cluded that here was a narrow-minded conventional girl who had somehow strayed into their group, and there was no harm in it, even if obviously she could contribute nothing to the purposes of the League, but she was good to look at, there was no denying that, and perhaps someday she would outgrow her petty bourgeois prejudices, so here was hope, and in the meantime one could wink meaningfully one to another, and later remark gaily that, "Our Rose, ain't she something; all female, not a spot of in­tellect." And even as they said "all female." their all maleness would rise to the challenge and despite their immature sophistication they would forget for an instant that they were political men and revolutionaries, and thus Rose took her place permanently in their minds too as a possibility of the future.</p>
<p>But Jacob understood much more than that, for was there not in that swarthy face also an expression of compassion while she made her in­sipid remark? No, it was not as simple as all that, he concluded ardently, allaying his own suspicions. Rose was more than a conventional foolish girl who somehow blundered into their group. She understood, he was con­vinced she understood, much much more than met the eye—the beauty of her face and the dark night in her eyes and the generous swell of her breasts testified to this understanding, and what she really meant was so much more mature and profound than any of the ideological talk. Tor though she used a slang expression common among the politically unde­veloped girls of the Bronx at that time, he argued mentally, that was merely out of habit, and her seemingly uncouth remark really meant, "Come now, I understand you. You are lost and bewildered children, self-exiled and a bit scared, and all this brave big talk, I know what it's worth. You have run away from your families and your homes and you shout that you have rejected them and all they stand for and you chatter of this and of that. But you don't really mean it at all. You are homesick and lost, that's what. You want to be grownup and you don't quite know how, that's why all the bluster. You talk about the falseness of society and the new man and the new life, but you are only clumsy children playing with big words, that's all. Consider your attitude toward me, for instance. You all stare at me when you think nobody notices, and you positively drool. What do you want? You want sex, of course, and you don't dare say so outright. You also want me to mother you, to reassure you of your manhood, to make you feel big and strong and confident and secure. But. how do you go about it? Has anyone of you as much as made a pass at me? No, like clumsy children you reach out for me and run. You want to know what does Comrade Rose think of the withering away of the state, and you care what Comrade Rose has to say about the speaker's opinions on the role of the farmers in an industrialized society. Like hell. I hear your questions and my heart shrinks within me. I feel such a compassion for you that I could embrace you all, I could give myself to all of you, if only in doing so I could somehow break the spell in which you are caught. No, you don't really care to know my opinions. You are just trying to set up some sort of contact with me, and through me to find life and you don't know how to go about it, and how to find it, and I am powerless to help you, at this time—for everything has its time and can no more be hurried than it can he delayed. And that is why I have no choice but to smile at your helplessness, for you are really good children at heart, and doomed to tragic failure, and so I say 'G'wan, you're kidding.' And when I say that I would also like to cry out to all of you, You are not kidding me, but for God's sake, stop kidding yourselves, before it is too late! For unless you do you will be lost forever, doomed to eternal exile. And perhaps—for of this I am not sure myself—when I say `G'wan, you're kidding,' I also mean that it doesn't matter the least little bit what we say here, either you or I, and so, though we are perhaps not free to escape these things that we do and say, at least let us not delude ourselves that we do what we want. For we are caught in a trap."</p>
<p>This and much more Jacob heard whenever Rose spoke her little formula and he would hasten to take the floor to express some opinion or other, not really caring to clarify some point under discussion but only to distract the attention of the group from Rose and from himself, for he was confused, and as he too momentarily snickered at her remark together with the others, he felt disloyal to her, and when he considered the inner import of her words, lie feared that tears might well into his eyes or he would in some other way make a spectacle of himself before the group, and that, of course, was unthinkable, unthinkable, and so he talked and talked and talked . . .</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>But all this was four years past, and now Jacob was twenty-three years old. And it was strange how everything had altered during these four years, yet nothing had changed. He had made his break from home, yet now he knew that despite the break he was bound to it as tightly as ever before. When he had to return home every night, he resented the bond. Now that a routine of once-a-week visit had long been established, he found it equally binding, and irksome and indissoluble. And in the meantime there had been many rooms in many houses—square rooms and oblong rooms, rooms with sloping ceilings and rooms with sharp corners, basement rooms and attic rooms, rooms overlooking streets and rooms without windows, rooms with abandoned small flower pots on window sills whose contents were a dry mixture consisting half of soil and half of cigarette ashes deposited by nameless predecessors arid in which Jacob futilely planted watermelon seeds brought from cafeterias only to watch the slight plants open hopefully then wither, and rooms with funereal plants that required neither sun nor moisture and that seemed to have been purloined from some under­taker's parlor, plants that neither rustled nor gave oil a smell and pointed resignedly and unflinchingly at the ceiling. The rooms invariably had doors through which Jacob entered and went out, and there were times when he brought up visitors, though such times were rare, but the great visit of which he had dreamed when he left home had not yet been made, and whichever room he moved to he filled with a great expectation which he postponed for the future.</p>
<p>Not that his life had been lacking in action, for Jacob had moved far and wide during these years, reaching out to the West coast in one direction and to Europe in the other, always expectant, always measuring himself against the challenge of the places he visited, and always finally aware that no matter how far he went he never exceeded the length of an invisible yet unbreakable line of force that pivoted about a center and that this center was in New York—in the Bronx as well as in the limited area down­town in which he vibrated restlessly and feverishly, and that to this center of his being he must always return. Vaguely he was beginning to discern, that New York, too, was not the ultimate center of his being, but at this point he lost the track—from here he would have to follow subterranean channels if he was to trace himself further back into his own history: channels which led God knew where, or that might even be endless. He was intrigued by the prospect yet always postponed the moment of begin­ning the deeper search, suspecting that this, too, would have to await its destined and inevitable moment.</p>
<p>He fidgeted nervously as he thought, Why in God's name do I always make such a production out of these visits? Get up and go!</p>
<p>For it was getting rather late, almost seven o'clock, and within himself he felt the shadows lengthening and there was much to do, terribly much to do. This was to be a crucial night, this much he felt intuitively as well as being aware of it rationally. There was the obvious reason, of course—tonight he was going to resign from the League for Revolutionary Action—at this evening's meeting he would read his resignation speech which he had secretly been working on for some months, and although he had reread the final draft of his speech many times during that clay and knew it by heart, down to its least comma, it burned like a hot coal in his pocket and ever so often his hand automatically reached toward it, and he wasn't quite certain whether he merely wanted to reassure himself that it was still there, or he wished to take it out and make sure that what was in it was quite what he intended to say.</p>
<p>The speech was his great secret, though it had been generally expected for some time by the members of his branch of the League that Jacob would resign. Many times during the preceding months they had had the oppor­tunity to note his lagging enthusiasm for the Cause, to see that serious doubts tormented him, that he was drifting off in a direction which they were glib enough to define and to deride but where they could not nor cared to follow. But in addition to this obvious reason there were others that were not clear even to himself. What was the great anxiety that was tugging at him, and what was the secret but overpowering elation that he felt within himself, as if someone inside were nudging him to get up on a platform and make some great declaration? Platforms? He had been on many of them in his time, though minor ones, to be sure, but never in the past had he felt as he did now. And the worst of it was that he had no clear idea of the great news that he felt impelled to proclaim—merely an urge to shout out something terribly important.</p>
<p>The visit had lasted longer than usual. Normally he would come at four in the afternoon and leave around six, despite all pleas that he stay longer. This time, remarkably, there were no urgent requests that he pro­long his stay. There was company in the house; not very important com­pany, merely a couple of neighbors who had dropped in, and Jacob's par­ents were engaged in conversation with them. When six o'clock came, he was about to say good bye and leave and was feeling prematurely irritated at the expected entreaties, but found to his amazement that lie was listen­ing very carefully to a conversation that under other circumstances he would have sneered at as so much idle twaddle.</p>
<p>The neighbors were two men in late middle age, somewhat younger than Jacob's parents. They had come into the apartment about hall an hour earlier and Jacob was introduced to one of them. The other remem­bered him from the time he was a youngster.</p>
<p>"This is my son Jacob; he's a student," his mother had said.</p>
<p>The neighbor who knew him shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly. Jacob's father said nothing and looked out the window toward the setting sun, slowly pulling on his long cigarette holder which he frequently fed with half cigarettes.</p>
<p>There was a brief silence after the initial formal remarks as the new­comers made themselves comfortable. Jacob suspected that everyone was ill at ease in his presence, and that on this one occasion his parents might even be glad to see him go, as if they had some secret to discuss with the visitors that was not fit for his ears.</p>
<p>"You're a student?" the first neighbor turned to Jacob. "So maybe you can explain it to us."</p>
<p>"Eh," the other neighbor said disparagingly, cancelling the question and the questioned one as well.</p>
<p>Jacob's mother looked apprehensively at him, as if she feared that he might take up the challenge and answer the question and then—he was her son, of course, and she admired him and loved him and trembled over him, but what did lie know? What did any of these youngsters know? They knew, of course they knew a lot, but what kind of knowledge was it! Of what use was their knowledge! She was an old and ignorant woman, naturally, but she knew things that one does not speak about, things that cannot be spoken about because there are no words for them. Conversation was simply a form, concealing the things mentioned verbally. But the poor children—they still talked as if they meant what they said. Hence she was apprehen­sive that Jacob might be so rude as to enter a conversation that was not meant for him and that was not conducted in a language he could really understand.</p>
<p>Not that she articulated these things in her mind; but then she mis­judged her son, too. For Jacob, with the manuscript of his speech of resig­nation bulging in his pocket, had no intention of taking up this challenge and was in fact no longer the son his mother had known in preceding years.</p>
<p>"They say he will attack Poland," the first neighbor remarked.</p>
<p>"May his name and memory be wiped out," the second neighbor and Jacob's father responded ritually, while his mother nodded piously and whispered: "Amen."</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>And where, Jacob mused, where did the revolution learn this Jewish phrase: "May his name and memory be wiped out!" And why had it become so obsessed with it that every time it devoured one of its own sons, or cast out a heretic, it hastened madly with its blood-stained erasers to wipe out the name of the one stricken from the rolls, so that the annals of the revolu­tion were spotted with rough blanks where a proud name had once been inscribed, and with entire pages missing from its own history books. And why do they, as well as these humble people of the Bronx, attach so much importance to name and memory? First they all rush to change their names to all kinds of symbolic ones, and then, at the slightest sin, real or imagin­ary, the first punishment they can think of is to wipe out the name from the book of the brave and the true. God is also a name, the Name. They call him Hashem, or Hadoshem, or more reverently, Hashem yisborech—the Name, be He Blessed.</p>
<p>Recalling reality he smiled at his strange thoughts and his hand in­voluntarily moved to his pocket where his resignation speech was. And what will she say? he thought. What will Rose say after he announced his resignation from the League?</p>
<p>He started to rise from his chair and to say good bye but a sharp pain in his groin at the thought of Rose, a cramp that constricted the lower part of his abdomen forced him to resume his seat. He blushed inwardly and thought: "Tonight," without further amplifying this thought.</p>
    • <p>* *</p>
<p>"A murderer," the first neighbor said.</p>
<p>"What else?" the other two men responded.</p>
<p>"Oi-i-i-," the mother sighed and slowly walked out of the room.</p>
<p>"He should be made shorter by a head," the first neighbor said.</p>
<p>"And who will do it?" Jacob's father sneered.</p>
<p>"If I were young," the first neighbor sighed.</p>
<p>All three looked in Jacob's direction for an instant, as if expecting him to undertake at once an expedition to make the murderer shorter by a head; then they averted their eyes from him.</p>

<p>Jacob grinned slyly. Not a bad idea, not a bad idea at all. What if he were to forget his League, and his resignation from it, and Rose, and the whole mess and undertake one meaningful trip in his life, not just a wan­derer's pointless flight goaded by shapeless furies but a trip with an aim to it, a trip like a directed arrow, to make evil shorter by a head, for evil resides in the head and once it is decapitated, then. . . . But what if evil rests in the heart, a headless monster. . . .</p>
<p>Enough, enough, he admonished himself. These people are talking sense and you are, as usual, busy with words that follow a pulsing spiral, now expanding now contracting but never getting, to the heart of the matter. Better listen to them.</p>

<p>"I have relatives in Poland," the first neighbor said as Jacob's mother returned to the room with a trayful of glasses of tea which she placed before the visitors and her husband.</p>
<p>"Will you have some?" she casually asked Jacob expecting him to re­fuse. "No, no," he hurriedly refused, as if he had been invited to join in a ritual that was taboo for him.</p>
<p>"I have relatives all over Poland," the first neighbor elaborated as he stirred his tea and watched the slice of lemon galloping gracefully like a circus horse along the rim of the glass.</p>
<p>"We all have relatives all over Poland," Jacob's mother added matter of factly.</p>
<p>"And why only Poland? You think he'll stop with Poland?" Jacob's father asked.</p>
<p>"It's the end of the world," the second neighbor said as he gingerly lifted the hot glass between two fingers.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The end of the world, the apocalypse, the four horsemen. How many times had not Jacob speculated on the end of the world! The end of the world was a purple glow under which mobs of men and women and children rushed carrying banners and shouting something ecstatically. That was the end of a dying world, he had assured himself, that would usher in the new era of—but now he blushed at the thought of the ballooning platitudes he used to indulge in. There was also another end of the world, of an entirely different sort, and Jacob had at one time defined it in time and located it in space. The end, he had once decided, would come on a cold and windy winter night. It would come in Chicago and its exact location would be at South State Street and Roosevelt Road. It had to be there and nowhere else. He vividly remembered how he had reached this conclu­sion. It had happened about two and a half years earlier. He was in Chicago and mostly unemployed. The previous evening he had attended for the first time a meeting of the Chicago branch of the League. He had been met courteously yet somewhat suspiciously. A Comrade from New York? Staying in Chicago for long? Tell us about the movement in New York! Oh, the comrade is just staying here a short time! Taking the Grand Tour, Jacob overheard someone in an aside. Well, well, you are sure welcome. We are always glad to welcome a comrade from out of town. Say, I have been thinking of going to New York myself. We are discussing tonight the question of socialist aspects of the corporate state. Have you read the article on this subject by Comrade Brown?</p>
<p>The meeting place in a loft building on Lake Street was overheated but Jacob sensed the cutting cold wind that was blowing hard from Lake Michigan outside and it made him shiver. He wanted to leave the meeting with the same intensity that at other times he had wanted to leave home during his visits, but it would have been hard to give a good reason for the sudden departure, so he staved as long as was absolutely necessary and left at the first opportunity. He was not vet familiar with the geography of the city and started walking aimlessly, instinctively seeking the level of his own mood which, for no cogent reason that he could have given, was one of despair. He walked southward on brightly lit State Street which was almost deserted at this late hour and it seemed as if someone had for­gotten to turn off the lights but would soon recall it and come back and pull a switch and plunge the street into the darkness which belonged to its wind-swept barrenness. But after he reached Harrison Street, and State Street became shabby and dimly lit, he felt more in sympathy with it and slowed down. The socialist aspects of the corporate fascist state, he thought with distaste and wished he could spit the words and the idea out of his mouth and mind. But the phrase and the idea obligingly retreated from his consciousness. In the square glare of the marquee of the Rialto Theater he stopped for a moment. The multitude of lights accentuated the icy wind, and the more than life-size picture of the near-nude burlesque queen per­forming inside, cosily inclosed in glass cases, mocked him and the handful of other men who had stopped to look, with the promise of brownish warmth. Go in? he wondered an instant but looked at the price over the ticket window and decided against the idea. He crossed Harrison Street and found himself in a shabby block of pawnshops, second hand clothing stores, and darkened closed little shops. The upper stories were nearly all dark, and he stopped to look at the block-long expanse of darkened brick-encircled dirty windows. What goes on behind these windows? he won­dered. During the day, what unearthly occupations arc indulged in there? The windows were very small, and even in the dim light that seeped up to them from below he could see that they were encrusted with an age-old layer of dirt. There must be mice and rats and rags there, he thought. But what could people possibly do there, even in daytime?. </p>
<p>"Interested in a nice suit, cheap?" Jacob was blasted out of his reverie by the sound of the words. He had not noticed that he had stopped not two steps away from the entrance to a second hand clothing shop. The man be­hind the door had been eyeing him for some time and concluded that Jacob was undecided whether to come in or not so he opened the door and addressed him.</p>
<p>"Suit?" Jacob wondered.</p>
<p>"We got a nice choice, fella. Come right in. Got just the thing for you, from a rich businessman, died last week, come in, come in and try it on. Just the thing for you," the man reached out to take Jacob's arm.</p>
<p>"He died, you say?" Jacob asked. "What did he die from?"</p>
<p>The man's outstretched hand dropped before it touched Jacobs arm. "What goes on up there?" Jacob asked pointing to the dark upper stories.</p>
<p>"Up where?" the man said suspiciously and a little belligerently. "There, upstairs," Jacob pointed again.</p>
<p>"Upstairs?' the man repeated and stepped back and looked about him­self, as if to make sure that there were other people nearby in case of trouble with this suspicious character. Then his face lit tip with compre­hension and relief. "Naw, you got to go a few blocks further south for that. Come on in, fella, and try on that suit I was telling you about. You won't find another buy like this."</p>
<p>"No, I want to know what goes on upstairs, in all these darkened floors, during the clay," Jacob insisted.</p>
<p>The man shrugged his shoulders and retreated to the warmth of his store. Jacob remained another minute, then proceeded southward. He passed more grimy little stores then another burlesque theater. Here too he stopped to look at the pictures which, unlike the ones before the Rialto, were coarser and presented an array of heavy-thighed beefy chorus girls. The price was only a quarter. Go in and warm tip for a while? he thought, attracted by the picture of the line of bosomy girls as well as the thought of the warm interior of the theater. But again he mechanically walked on without answering his own question. State Street here was more open to the wind as the building became lower and the cold now penetrated his coat. It also became more menacing as the pools of light diminished in number. A few dejected looking people passed hint and he felt suspicious of them. Openings between the buildings led to mysterious dark alleyways littered with trash. He discerned some obscure movements in these alleys and walked by them rapidly. When lie saw a dimly lit marquee about a block away, he walked toward it purposefully. It was another burlesque theater and this time the admission was fifteen cents only. He bought a ticket and went inside.</p>
<p>The theater was small and mostly empty, but it was warm and Jacob took off his coat and made himself comfortable. He had empty seats on either side of him. Further down the row he discerned, as soon as his eyes became accustomed to the darkness, a poorly dressed man soundly asleep. Across the aisle a couple were busy petting and paid no attention to the stage where in a garish red glow the chief attraction went through her grinds and bumps. She was no longer a young woman and as Jacob looked at her closely he became aware that she was tired to the point of exhaustion. Her breasts, once large and probably shapely, were now sag­ging and moved with perceptible looseness in the filmy web of skin-colored gauze that held them. With each bump the soft skin on the inside of her thighs wrinkled beneath her G string. She strained to maintain a smile of lustful abandon but the effort seemed to be too great for her and her face periodically contorted with the effort.</p>
<p>Jacob averted his eyes from the stage and looked about himself. A scattering of heads, many of them bald, were discernible in the deep twi­light of the small auditorium. Some of the heads rested on the backs of the seats, asleep; others nodded rhythmically to the beat of the drum that punctuated the bumps.</p>
<p>He turned toward the stage once more. The act was approaching its crescendo. The drum beat came faster, the two saxophones and one trom­bone howled in a poor imitation of passionate wailing. The contortions of the woman on the stage became quicker and now suggested convulsions. Her face was covered with perspiration. Her breasts shook in their filmy halter and Jacob thought he discerned vertical wrinkles running clown them toward the nipples. The muscles of her legs bulged with each grind and there was no doubt now that the skin on her thighs crumpled as she bumped.</p>
<p>As the act finished in a blare of sound amid a thin scattering of weak applause Jacob quickly walked up the aisle toward the exit, putting on his coat as he went. The wind caught him as he emerged and turned him southward down the bleak expanse of State Street. Ile walked rapidly. Dry powdery snow was now sifting clown thinly and the wind mixed it with the cold dust and scraps of papers and drove it before him in spasmodic gusts. He walked on until he came to Roosevelt. Road. On the overpass the rumble of a passing truck suggested movement and life. Beneath the overpass, on State Street, there was not a soul in sight. A street lamp shivered disconsolately in the bitter cold. The blowing dust and trash came to rest for a moment. Jacob stopped and pulled up his collar.</p>
<p>This is the end of the world, he said to himself. Here is the end of the world. The sun has died. Life has died. Warmth has died. At this inter­section of a frigid, empty street and a frozen empty world the world comes to an end.</p>
<p>After standing thus for a minute or two he fled, guided by the rooftop lights on the towering YMCA hotel a few blocks away. He walked as fast as he could and dashed into the lobby, his hands and face tingling with the frost. The clerk looked at him disapprovingly as he registered and gave him the key to a room. He went up in an elevator that ascended at dizzying speed and walked down a corridor where men in bathrobes walked back and forth. The place smelled like an athletes' shower room of sweat, strong soap and damp towels. He found his room number and quickly turned the key in the lock and shut the door behind himself. The room was minute and immaculate. It was also overheated. Like a white-washed coffin, Jacob mentally noted. The sheets on the narrow bed were drawn with army regulation tightness. He quickly undressed and got into bed. He picked up the Bible near the head of his bed and opened it at random: A Voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of bitter crying, Rachel is mourning for her sons.</p>
<p>But this voice was then too remote for Jacob to hear it distinctly and he laid down the book.</p>
<p>Now I know a great and terrible secret, he thought: A few blocks away, at State and Roosevelt, the world is coming to an end.</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>"Nonsense," Jacob's father derisively waved his hand holding the long cigarette holder. "The world is not coming to an end yet. They come and they go; they come and they go, and this one will go the way of the others."</p>
<p>"Amen, may it be so," the mother interjected.</p>
<p>"The wars of Gog and Magog; the end of the world," the second neighbor refused to be consoled.</p>
<p>"I have relatives all over Poland. They say he will attack Poland," the first neighbor reiterated.</p>
<p>"We all have relatives all over Poland," Jacob's mother repeated.</p>
<p>"Israel is eternal," Jacob's father said. "They come and they go and Israel remains. Surely you must have heard the old parable. Israel is like a small weak rooster among many strong ones. The strong ones pursue it and do not let it come near the feeding trough. The weak one is grow­ing ever weaker from insufficient food and is compelled to hide for fear of the strong ones. But they, the strong roosters, are arrogant and fight viciously among themselves until in their insolent pride they all kill each other, and then the small weak rooster comes out and feeds at the troughs and grows big and strong and sleek, and pecks at the carcasses of its dead tormentors."</p>
<p>"God willing we will survive," Jacob's mother interjected.</p>
<p>"Some will survive, God only knows how many," the second neighbor refused to be consoled.</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>Thus the conversation moved in measured cadences, and Jacob listened entranced to its dance-like rhythms as speaker verbally approached speaker, bowed gracefully with a time-hallowed remark then turned away.</p>
