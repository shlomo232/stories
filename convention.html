    <h1>The Convention</h1>
<p>I am a steady person and always have been one. I am a bookkeeper. I live alone, in a rooming house in a modest but respectable neighborhood. My habits, too, are steady. Every morning I buy my paper and a package of cigarettes at the counter in the lunch shop on the corner, where I have my breakfast coffee. I have been doing this for many years.</p>
<p>What could have caused me to change from this sensible habit? I don't know. It may have been fate. But on this particular morning I started out earlier than usual and I did not stop at the lunch shop. Instead I de­cided to walk to my office. It took me longer than I had expected and when</p>
<p>I was still a block away I noticed that I had only five minutes left. I at once realized that I did not have enough time for coffee but I quickly stepped into the lobby of a big hotel to buy cigarettes, because I am a heavy smoker, this being the only vice I permit myself in my otherwise steady life. At the cigar counter I patiently waited my turn behind two tall and dignified men. While waiting I heard one of them say to the other: "Well, Jim, so I'll see you at the Convention this week end." And the other man answered: "You bet, Bill. See you there. We'll get Jones elected. Just wait and see."</p>
<p>It upset me very much to realize that the Convention was to be held so soon. Here it was already Wednesday, yet I was completely unprepared. Because of my unforgivable neglect, I would now have to take a day off from my job to make the last-minute arrangements. For one thing, I was short of clothes, small items but important ones, such as extra shirts, socks and ties, which I could well do without for some time, but that I positively must have on my trip to the Convention. Also my car urgently needed some small but essential repairs before I could undertake the trip.</p>
<p>I nearly forgot to mention that I have an old car which I bought second-hand as a fine bargain some six years ago and which I have kept ever since. You might wonder, of course, why a man of my steady habits who does not go gallivanting about the country and lives alone quietly and modestly should need a car. This is a good question, but it shows a lack of understanding of my character. I have numerous cultural and social interests and I take a keen interest in events. So, when some six years ago a neighbor, who then lived across the hall, mentioned to me that he had a used car which he was desperately anxious to sell, I immediately took a keen interest in it. My neighbor had asked me whether I might not know anyone interested in buying an old car in serviceable condition. He was tremendously surprised when I said with a smile, "I might know of someone; in fact, I might be interested in buying it myself." "You:" he said, hardly believing his ears. "Yes," I said, "I might very well be interested. Can you show it to me tomorrow?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That evening I went to see my friend Eddie who lives in the same house with me and whom I deeply respect. Eddie is a very smart man. As was our custom, we first played a couple of rounds of checkers and then Eddie made some tea for me, for he no longer drinks tea on account of his heart. While we were at tea, I said, "Eddie, I plan to buy a car." As usual, Eddie did not respond at once. He is a very deliberate man who carefully weighs all his opinions. But from the expression on his face and the flicker of light in his eyes, I could tell that my idea appealed to him. "Why do you want a car?" he asked before giving his opinion. "Well," I began, "it occurred to me . . ." But before I had a chance to explain my views, Eddie interrupted me. "You need not apologize," he said in his usual kindly tone. "I understand quite well why a young man like you should want a car." Eddie, you see, is in his early sixties, while I am still in my early fifties. "No, you need not apologize," he repeated. "It is a good idea. A young man like you must live actively--though not rashly, of course," he added with a slight wink. "And besides, there are occasions, important unforeseen occasions . . ." he concluded.</p>
<p>I knew exactly what he meant and my mind was almost made up.</p>
<p>I also mentioned the matter to Miss Marybelle, who is my other friend in the house and whom I visit often, alone or together with Eddie whom she also likes, though sometimes I think that she likes me more. She was delighted. "An automobile! How wonderful!" she exclaimed. "Just think of all the places one could go. And then," she added, "there are those special occasions when one needs a car."</p>
<p>The next day the man showed me the car. It seemed to be in rather poor condition, so that I doubted for a moment. But I am not mechanically minded and he assured me that, with a little care now and then, it would run quite well. "And," he said rather meaningfully, "you never know when one of those special occasions comes up when a man absolutely needs a car." I was surprised to hear him express the same thought that Eddie and Miss Marybelle expressed the night before, and I bought his car.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the car required considerable repair, and after this was done I used to take it out for a few blocks on Sundays, not because I needed it for any special trip, but to activate it, so to speak. However, I never forgot that a special occasion might arise when I would need it. Now was such an occasion, yet here I was unprepared for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I decided at once that I must ask my boss, Mr. J. H. Bigelow to have Friday off. This is very much against my principles as I never ask for time off unless I am quite sick. But the importance of the event just­ified it, I felt. I did not quite know how to explain the matter to Mr. Bigelow and I was reluctant to face him, especially since I have scarcely ever had any direct dealings with him from the day I was hired some twenty-five years ago. Mr. Bigelow is a very important man, you must realize, and has no time for small matters. Of course, everyone in the office refers to him as J.H., but this is because he is such a fine person, not because of familiarity with him. I was therefore in some trepidation about seeing him. But late in the afternoon I passed Mr. Bigelow's office and he was standing in the corridor talking to someone, so I discreetly stopped some distance away. He noticed me, with some irritation I thought, and asked what I wanted. This was only natural considering how busy he always is with impor­tant matters. I told him that I would be very grateful if I could have Friday off, or at least the afternoon, since I had to go to Atlantic City to the Convention.</p>
<p>"The Convention?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said.</p>
<p>"The Convention?" "In Atlantic City?" he asked again.</p>
<p>His mind must have been quite preoccupied or he would have at once grasped the importance of the matter. But he quickly realized what is was all about and said, "O.K., take Friday afternoon off," and resumed his con­versation with the other man.</p>
<p>That's the kind of man Mr. Bigelow is—generous as well as under­standing.</p>
<p>This lifted a burden off my mind, though I was still quite excited about the great event before me. On Friday I left the office at one o'clock and rushed to the garage where I kept my car, and gave the mechanic in­structions to put it in good running order as I needed it for an important trip out of town. I started telling him that I was going to the Convention in Atlantic City and that I was confident that Jones would be elected there, but he did not seem to care and I do not like to force my interests on other people. Of course, the election of Jones was just as important for him as it was for me and for everybody else, but since he did not seem to realize it, I did not wish to pursue the matter. Then I went to the bank to take out money for the trip and for my purchases. There was not much in my checking account, and since I had left the office early I would not get my week's salary till Monday. I therefore withdrew all I had except one dollar, to keep the account active, so to speak, and went to make my purchases. This took me quite some time, for besides my usual care in such matters, always trying to buy shirts and ties and socks that are in good taste and also economical, there was my special concern that they should be just right for the Convention. The shopping therefore took me consider­ably longer than I had anticipated and it was almost five o'clock when I came to get my car. But here was an unpleasant surprise. It seems that it needed some new parts whose names I am not familiar with if it was to be fit for a long trip and these added up to a considerable sum, more in fact that I had with me. I pleaded with the mechanic that he accept a small sum on account and that I would pay the balance when I returned from the Convention, but he refused. I tried to urge on him the importance of my being in Atlantic City when the Convention opened that evening, but he would not listen to reason.</p>
<p>I therefore had no choice but to return to my room for the time be­ing and to postpone the trip for the following morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the evening I went to Eddie and explained my predicament to him. He was quite understanding and would have willingly lent me the money I needed, but as it happened he did not have any to spare, which was quite to be expected in his situation. But he was most encouraging nonetheless. "Don't worry," he said to me with a smile. "You will somehow manage to go tomorrow. One always finds a way when matters of such importance are at stake. And Jones will be elected, too," he added. This reassured me greatly and we both went across the hall to visit Miss Marybelle. "The Convention? You didn't go?" she gasped when she saw me. I explained to her the reason for my delay. She felt relieved and at once offered to lend me the money I needed. I had always known that she was a loyal 'friend and this proved it once more--as if it needed additional proof."</p>
<p>"Now you have nothing to worry about," she said cheerfully, "and you will be there in plenty of time. Ah, Atlantic City!" she exclaimed enthusiastically. "I was there once, when I was a girl! How I loved it Oh, if I only had a chance to see it again!"</p>
<p>I felt that since she had made it possible for me to go, it was my duty to invite her to come along, but I at once realized that in this case I should not heed the call of duty. It was not simply that we were only neighbors, even though very friendly ones, and it would not be proper for us to travel together. There was the matter of the Convention. It wasn't a pleasure trip, and I would be preoccupied with the Convention and would not be able td escort her properly. She of course understood me quite well and did not press the matter.</p>
<p>Saturday morning I went in to say goodby to Eddie and to Miss Mary-belle. They both wished me bon voyage and I left in high spirits. But before starting on the trip it occurred to me that I had forgotten something very important. What I needed was a convention button or badge or perhaps even a banner such as college students have, with the name Jones on it. I did not know where to get it and tried one store after another, but nowhere did they have what I needed. I was rather amazed at this—that the stores should not be adequately supplied for such a momentous event. In the end, seeing how much time I had wasted in the search, I consented to a compromise that was suggested to me, though as a matter of principle I do not like to compromise. The saleslady at the last store I went to was very much dis­appointed that she could not fill my order and very kindly offered to make up a little banner for me. This was a stationery and school-supplies store. She therefore took a package of alphabet flash cards and selecting the appro­priate letters she made up a very fine little poster which, she said, I could paste on my windshield. I felt very bad that I had put her to all this trouble and tried to apologize. "Surely, you realize," I said, "that I wouldn't have insisted if it weren't so important. But Jones must be elected." She readily agreed with me, as I had expected she would and now I was all ready for the trip. I looked at my watch and saw that it was quite late.</p>
<p>I pasted the little poster on my windshield and started off gaily, confident that all would now go well, and happy that despite all the little hindrances and setbacks which are unavoidable in all important events, I was finally on my way and would partake in the historic event. As I raced down the highWay I even caught myself humming, "For Jones is a jolly good fellow," but I stopped this at once, as it was not dignified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had to stop a couple of times on the way to add oil to the motor which was using it up quite fast because of its age, and once I also went in to have some lunch. But these halts were not entirely a waste of time since people noticed the sign on my windshield. Some of them even smiled their approval and one little boy, seeing the sign, pointed to me and cried out, "Mr. Jones!" I did not get in to Atlantic City till late in the afternoon. Considering that I was traveling on borrowed money I decided to take the most modest accommodations I could find, even though the occasion merited something more elaborate. I therefore drove around the streets for the better part of an hour until I found a small two-story house near the outskirts which had a weather-beaten wooden sign saying, "Guests," and underneath this, "Conventioners Welcome."</p>
<p>The second inscription convinced me to lodge in this house.</p>
<p>I range the bell and the landlady, an elderly woman, opened the. door for me. "I am here for the Convention," I said, "and I see that you welcome conventioners."</p>
<p>"Will you have the four-dollar room on the second floor or the four-fifty one downstairs?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I think I'd better take the four-dollar room," I said. "I am somewhat late; I really expected to get here yesterday night or this morning at the latest. Have you heard perhaps how Jones' chances are at the Convention?"</p>
<p>The landlady's hearing seemed to have been deficient, for she said, "Come right in, Mr. Jones," and she led me to a downstairs room which rented for four-fifty.</p>
<p>However, I did not care to make an issue of this since it was already late and I was anxious to go about my important business. I gave the land­lady her rent and, leaving my car at the curb, I started walking in the direction of the center of the city.</p>
<p>Atlantic City is beautiful and quite an appropriate site for such an important event. The main streets are brilliantly lit up, and nearby the ocean breakers roar on the beach. I could not help feeling as if all this great illumination and festive air had been specially arranged for the Con­vention, and in my heart I repeated a little prayer: "Please God, let Jones be elected," Thus I walked about for quite a while along the main streets and on the boardwalk until I became tired and went into a little coffee shop to relax for a while. The place was crowded and people talked with great animation. In my tiredness I paid no attention to them, but it seems that my little prayer which I had been repeating in my mind was now also on my lips and that, unaware of it, I was articulating it quite audi­bly, for a man at my side looked at me for a while and said, "I see that you are a Jones man, Bud." "And who wouldn't be?" I said. The man looked at me again rather strangely, then he said, "You'd be surprised, fella, but there are quite a few who aren't." This thoroughly woke me out of my reverie for I sensed danger to the cause. "Impossible:" I cried. "You bet there are," the man insisted with what seemed to me unnecessary glee. "Are you, too, perhaps . . ." I began, and could not finish my question, but the man reassured me at once, "Don't you worry," he said, and for some reason he winked at the waitress who had noticed our conversation. "Don't you worry about me. I am strictly a true-blue, one-hundred-percent Jones man myself."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next morning I went downtown feeling quite optimistic. It was a beautiful day and I joined the crowds strolling on the boardwalk. All the auguries seemed to predict success and I therefore felt confident and relaxed and decided to use a little time to attend to some private matters. Spe­cifically, I thought that it would be a fitting gesture on my part if I bought some gifts for Eddie and Miss Marybelle. This seemed especially im­portant since they did not share my great privilege in going to the Conven­tion. I walked along the boardwalk for many blocks, stopping at each shop to inspect the displays. There are hundreds of stores and each has a more tantalizing array of gifts than the next, so that I was quite confused. After some hours of walking up and down the boardwalk I decided to get a tie for Eddie. But it was more difficult to pick something suitable for Miss Marybelle. However, as so frequently happens on such occasions, the problem was solved for me without my helf. I had just stopped in front of a shop where an auction was being held and the auctioneer was displaying a brilliant red scarf with big gold lettering on it, "Souvenir from Atlan­tic City." The auctioneer was addressing about half a dozen people before him when he noticed me standing in the doorway and at once turned to me. "Come in, come in, Mr. Jones; don't block the door. Lots of other people are anxious to come in." I felt rather guilty for having blocked the door­way, so I walked in, but I did correct the auctioneer about my name. "My name is not Jones," I said. "No offense meant, no offense meant at all," he hastened to apologize. "In a way we are all Mr. Joneses, aren't we?" he asked the other people. They laughed approvingly and one or two assented, "We sure are." I could see that they were all supporters of Jones, even as I was, and I felt very friendly toward them and toward the auctioneer. Besides, I thought the red scarf with the large gold lettering was very beautiful and would be just right for Miss Marybelle and she would certainly love it. "You in town for a convention?" the auctioneer asked in mock ig­norance. "Yes, I am here for the Convention," I said. "We are all here for a convention," the auctioneer admitted. One could see he was a great joker. "Yeah, all one big happy family come to Atlantic City for a con­vention. And now, ladies and gentlemen, and especially you," the auctioneer addressed himself to me, "this grand scarf is worth at least fifty dollars in any reputable store, and I mean the scarf only, without the lettering of pure gold leaf, yet here I am bid only three dollars for it. That's a shame, that's a steal I would say, if it weren't that I can tell by all your honest faces that you are all people of integrity. You," he again turned directly to me, "you there, come over, don't be bashful, just feel this cloth, Mr. Jones, but oh well, we can't all be Mr. Jones, as I was telling my wife last night, she was in a bad humor, see, so I was trying to soothe her and I says . . . But ladies and gentlemen, and this gentleman especially, let me assure you on my word of honor that if it weren't against the regulations of this establishment I'd get down on the floor myself and bid for this gorgeous scarf, and I wouldn't bid a measly three dollars, I can tell you that; I wouldn't have the heart to bid a mere three dollars for such a grand scarf, not to mention the pure gold leaf lettering on it, so what am I bid. What do you bid?" he again spoke directly to me. I saw he was right and bid five dollars.</p>
<p>"Now, here's a man who appreciates good material," the auctioneer complimented the, "he knows a good thing when he sees it, even if his name is not Jones. Now who will bid six dollars," he said and winked at the others. He was a great joker, there was no question about that, but the spirit caught on and somebody raised his hand and said, "I bid six dollars, for Mr. Jones' sake." I had been anxious to get the scarf from the very beginning, and now there was an additional incentive, for in bidding for it I was also demonstrating my loyalty to Jones. I therefore increased my bid to seven, and then the others raised their bids still further, until the last bid stood at nineteen dollars. I quietly took out my wallet and as unobtrusively as I could, I counted the money I had left. There were twenty-one dollar bills and some change. The others watched me and I bid twenty dollars. No one bid again and the scarf was mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took the tie and the scarf and walked back to my lodging and locked the gifts in the car. It was already after one and I had to check out of my room by three o'clock. But as these last minutes passed I became ever more anxious to learn the outcome of the voting at the Convention which should take place at about this time. I therefore returned downtown, eager for some word in this regard. Alas, I did not have to wait long, and the news was enough to destroy all my cheer of the morning. A group of people on the boardwalk before one of the very biggest hotels were listening to a man who was obviously angry and spoke in a loud voice. I distinctly heard him say: "That guy from Peoria. He was the only one. If it hadn't been for him, all would have been well. I'm telling you, it was all in the bag, until that guy from Peoria loused it up."</p>
<p>I did not stop to hear any more. So Jones had lost, after all and by one vote. For a moment I felt as if the boardwalk were giving way under my feet. But I quickly regained my composure. I am a steady person, even in great adversity. But what, I wondered, could have gotten into the man from Peoria? What was the matter with Peoria anyway?</p>
<p>I went back to check out of my lodging and started for home. I re­turned well after dark.. At first I was so despondent that I thought I would not see Eddie or Miss Marybelle that evening. But what can be more consol­ing than good friends? Besides, I wanted to give them their gifts.</p>
<p>Like true friends they did not wait for me to call on them. Half an hour after I returned, they knocked on my door. They sensed the bad news even before I told them, and they were dejected. But they did not know the details.</p>
<p>"He lost, Jones lost by only one vote. Peoria did it for him," I told them.</p>
<p>It was just like my friend Eddie to console me. "Bear up, he said. "The blow is equally hard on all of us. But let us not despair. There is always another time."</p>
<p>That was just like Eddie, calm in distress. But Miss Marybelle only said: "What could be the matter with Peoria?"</p>
<p>It was a sad reunion. But we took it as calmly as we were able. To relieve the anxiety, Eddie did suggest after a while that we have a couple of rounds of checkers and then Miss Marybelle could make tea, which Eddie, of course, did not drink on account of his heart. But Miss Marybelle cut him short, which is very unlike her though forgiveable under the circum­stances. She said: "At a time like this you ought to forget your silly checkers." Then turning to me she said. "It is a lovely scarf and I shall always treasure it." And then, speaking all our minds, she said again: "What could be the matter with Peoria?"</p>
<p>The next morning I got up earlier than was my custom, due to the great excitement of the weekend I suppose. I went into my usual coffee shop and took my regular place. But this morning I was preoccupied with urgent thoughts. This must not happen again, I firmly said to myself. Jones must not be defeated again. I must start at once to plan the strategy for next time. And the key to this strategy obviously is the answer to the question: "What is the matter with Peoria?"</p>
