    <h1>The Lover</h1>
<p>Harry and Anne sat on the stairs in front of the brownstone rooming house. It was well past midnight and sultry and humid. All the other tenants had retired for the night, and from time to time there was heard the sound of someone clearing his throat or of a window being opened wider as the sweltering people in the shabbily overfurnished small rooms struggled for more air.</p>
<p>Though still in his early forties, Harry's wrinkled face and thin greying hair made him look much older than his age. His square heavy head sat almost flat on his broad shoulders, as if he had no neck at all, and its weight seemed to cause his back to curve and lent an ape-like quality to his torso. His face bore an ingratiating smile.</p>
<p>"Annie," he said to the woman who sat two steps below him.</p>
<p>"Yes, Harry," she answered looking up to him. She was a plain-faced though well-built woman in her mid-thirties. In the casual light of the street her face lacked color and expression, and her straight brownish hair was combed back flat. But as she half turned toward Harry, her full breasts heaved wavelike, and the wheedling expression on Harry's face momentarily gave way to a hungry smirk.</p>
<p>"Let's go down to the corner and have a beer; it's hot tonight," he said.</p>
<p>"Thanks, I don't feel like it," she answered, but seeing the creases on his face wrinkle with hurt, she added less brusquely, "not now, some other time."</p>
<p>"Oh, come on, it's a hot night; it will cool you off," he begged and moved dowd one step toward her.</p>
<p>She did not answer his plea and he did not press the invitation. Instead he tentatively rested his hand on the step and slowly edged it closer to her, fearing a rebuff and ready to retreat.</p>
<p>"Annie," he said again a moment later.</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Lonesome?"</p>
<p>"Not particularly."</p>
<p>"I am"</p>
<p>"I know. There is much lonesomeness in the world."</p>
<p>"But you are not."</p>
<p>"Lots of times I am too."</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't we be friends?" he said moving down to her step. "But we are; haven't we lived in the same house for three years?" she answered and moved a little farther away from him.</p>
<p>"That's not the same thing; that's not what I mean," he said edging closer to her. "We could be friends, you and I; and you could make me happy. You could, you know it."</p>
<p>For some minutes they sat in silence, then Harry said: "Annie, you are beautiful."</p>
<p>"Stop it," she retorted and involuntarily straightened her skirt and reached to her bosom as if to close an additional nonexistent button.</p>
<p>"Why?" he pretended not to understand. "You are beautiful and I love you," he whispered.</p>
<p>She stirred as if to get up and leave and he quickly moved away from her and began to apologize. "I didn't mean to offend you. I really mean it, you're beautiful. Didn't I tell you so many times before? And I do love you." She settled back in her place and he proceeded with more assurance. "Couldn't you love me, just a little bit? What would it hurt you?"</p>
<p>"We've been through this before," she said curtly, though this time she did not move to get up. "I'm sorry, but I don't love you." And after a moment's pause, to change the subject, she said, "It's hot," and proceeded to pull a handkerchief from her skirt pocket and to wipe her forehead and neck.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes followed her gesture, then they left her hand as she moved it to replace the handkerchief and fixed themselves on the opening of the valley between her breasts.</p>
<p>"I know you don't love me," he said weepily. "I am ugly, a monster, to you, to everyone."</p>
<p>"Stop it," she scolded him again, but this time her voice was calm and without conviction. "I am sure you were loved before, and you will be loved again."</p>
<p>"Are you in love now?" he asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then why can't you love me just a little bit, eh? Just a little bit."</p>
<p>"I just don't. Let's not talk about this anymore. Please."</p>
<p>"I know, I know, you're right," he hastened to agree, and seeing her anger pass he returned to the assault.</p>
<p>"And you're good too," he said.</p>
<p>"How do you know? Maybe I'm not good at all," she said indifferently. "What I mean is, you're kind. I know. Haven't I seen how kind you are these three years?"</p>
<p>"I don't know if I am kind," she said. "Maybe I was not. A little kindness does make things easier," she added, staring into the street as if the words evoked some private memories.</p>
<p>"Then why aren't you kind to me? he seized his opportunity.</p>
<p>"How have I been unkind to you," she failed to grasp his intent for a second.</p>
<p>"I mean," he began and sidled up to her, "I mean, I know you don't love me, Who could love someone like me?" he added self-pityingly. "But now, if you were kind to me, you would . . . you know what I mean .	."</p>
<p>Anne did not answer and he moved closer and looked into her face hopefully, expectantly. He tentatively placed his hand on her knee, and when she did not object he began to knead it gently at first and then more firmly as he continued talking.</p>
<p>"It's not love I am asking of you, just a little kindness, and if you were kind to me, you would . . . you know what I mean . . . and why shouldn't you be a little kind to me? What would it hurt? And you yourself just now said how life can be made easier with a little kindness, but there are so many people who will refuse just this little bit of kindness . . . ."</p>
<p>Thus Harry continued for some time and his hand became bolder and moved from the knee to the thigh, and the wheedling expression on his face became insistent and demanding and a gleam of triumph stole into his eyes and was reflected by the street lamp down the block, so that when Anne later silently rose to go inside he followed her up the dreary staircase still talking though he was unsure whether he was guiding her to his own room or following her to hers.</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>In the morning the sun rose bright and hot and there was the promise of another very hot day. At half past eight Harry came out of the house, a look of insolent victory on his face, which he seemed anxious to share with someone. But the only person nearby was the taciturn janitor sweeping the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"It's gonna be another scorcher," Harry addressed the janitor in a voice unnaturally loud for him.</p>
<p>"Huh huh," the janitor grunted.</p>
<p>"Hot as hell last night," Harry refused to be discouraged.</p>
<p>"Yeh, sure was," the janitor agreed. "Damned uncomfortable," he added.</p>
<p>Harry looked at him and winked devilishly. "Uncomfortable? Nope: Not when you fall asleep with a pair of big tits in your hands."</p>
<p>The janitor stopped swinging the broom and stared at Harry as if trying to grasp some secret meaning in his remark.</p>
<p>"Heh heh heh," Harry snickered and pointed vaguely to a window in one of the upper floors. "That's a nice piece of ass there," he winked again.</p>
<p>The janitor's eyes followed the direction of Harry's hand. He stared toward the unidentified window still seeming not to understand, and then he resumed-his sweeping.</p>
<p>Harry turned away and started toward the corner. His square bulk shoved a column of air before him and was ready to shove everything else that came in his way. His back seemed to have straightened. The sneer in his small eyes drilled into the morning until he was lost around the corner.</p>
