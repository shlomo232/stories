    <h1>Four Midrashim</h1>
<p class=topnote>[Midstream, Autumn 1956, p.27-37]</p>

<p class=subtitle>Exile</p>
<p class=ital>So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flaming sword which turned every way . . . 				Genesis 3</p>
<p>WHAT is this place to which you are driving us?" Adam asked.</p>
<p>"It is outside the gates."</p>
<p>"Is it a large place?"</p>
<p>"It has a beginning, but no end," God answered.</p>
<p>"What is the name of this place to which Eve and I must now go?"</p>
<p>"It is outside, as I have told you."</p>
<p>"But does it not have a name? Where we are now is called the Garden of Eden, and I have also heard it called Paradise. But what is the name of the place where we must go? You say it is outside, but only by its name can we really know it."</p>
<p>"It is called Exile," God said.</p>
<p>"Exile?" Adam asked wonderingly and looked to Eve as if he expected her to explain the meaning of the word, but Eve said nothing and only cried softly.</p>
<p>"Exile," Adam repeated to himself. "It must be a place of terror. And all because we disobeyed You in such a little matter?" he asked and his words rang with protest, disbelief and irony.</p>
<p>"Do not say it is a little matter," God reproached him. "You cannot judge its magnitude or its importance. A man or woman may do what seems to them a small wrong, and perhaps do it by accident or through thoughtless­ness, yet like a stone thrown into a pool of water it starts a series of waves that roll in all directions to the end of space and through an eternity of time. And another may commit what appears to him to be a great wrong, yet it turns out to be only a small matter quickly forgotten and leaving no perma­nent trace."</p>
<p>"How, then, is one to judge?"</p>
<p>"You can only judge by the inevitable effects, and then it is too late."</p>
<p>"And our disloyalty is such a great wrong that it sends ripples of hurt to the end of space and time?"</p>
<p>"It is."</p>
<p>"I do not understand it," Adam said. "Do you understand it, Eve?" he asked.</p>
<p>Eve wept and did not answer.</p>
<p>"I do not understand it," Adam repeated. "Explain it to us, God. Our wrong is already done and cannot be undone. We have eaten of the Tree of Knowledge. Now we have understanding and the unspeakable punishment of Exile awaits us. Let us at least profit this one way from our wrong by understanding its nature and the reason for its infinite consequences."</p>
<p>"Until you were seduced by the snake," God said, "there was perfection. I was perfect. You were perfect. The entire world which I created was per­fect. Now it is no longer so. The harmony has been broken; the perfection of My creation has been scarred by your action. It is impossible to talk of a big wrong and a little wrong, just as it is impossible to conceive of a slight imperfection. Creation is either perfect or it is not. Do you understand now?"</p>
<p>Adam looked down on the ground. "I understand; at least I think I under­stand. We will go into the Exile that is outside, to eat our bread by the sweat of our brows, as You have said, to know pain and sorrow, and the grief of no return." He added with bitterness: "And You, God, will remain here in a Paradise that will be perfect once again, that will be made perfect by our departure into Exile."</p>
<p>"You have eaten of the Tree of Knowledge, and still you do not under­stand," God said. "Your reasoning is faulty, almost as if you had not eaten of the fruit of the Tree. Otherwise you would understand that perfection will not be restored by your departure. You are part of Me, even as I be­came a part of you when I blew the breath of life into you. Without you the Garden of Eden will be Paradise no longer. I could not rest knowing of your wanderings under a brazen sky, and that you constantly cry out to return. Your grief is My grief; your punishment is also Mine."</p>
<p>"Then forgive us, God; forgive us and let us not go into Exile," Adam begged.</p>
<p>God shook His head, "I cannot."</p>
<p>"Why?" Adam cried in anguish. "Let us be reconciled; take us back to Yourself."</p>
<p>"I cannot, now," God answered in a whisper.</p>
<p>"You are abandoning us then to the terrors of Exile?" Adam cried.</p>
<p>"No," God said. "We must suffer alike. Now that I have imposed this great punishment upon you, I, too, cannot remain in Paradise. I, too, will go."</p>
<p>"With us?" Adam asked hopefully.</p>
<p>"With you, yet not with you," God answered. "I will go out of the East gate of the Garden of Eden together with you, and then our paths will part. I, too, will go into Exile, but My Exile will not be quite like yours. You go because in innocence you have done a great wrong. I go to atone for the great punishment which I have imposed upon you. I must win My own for­giveness, and also yours, as you must have Mine."</p>
<p>"Why can't we go together? Eve and I are afraid to go by ourselves!" Adam begged.</p>
<p>"We cannot go together."</p>
<p>"Won't You ever become reconciled to us?"</p>
<p>"We will go, each his own way," God answered, "always seeking, always yearning for each other. Yet our Exiles will have to follow their separate courses—and Paradise must stand empty, the angels with the double-edged swords guarding an untenanted Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>"Only at the end of eternity, when time, curved upon itself, returns to its beginning, will we meet again, reconciled and at peace, neither guilty nor forgiving."</p>

<p class=subtitle>The Rejected</p>
<p class=topnote>[Jewish Frontier, March 1954, 23-24]</p>
<p class=ital>And it came to pass . . . that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him . . . Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering. . . . And they came to the place which God had told him of, and Abraham built an altar there . . . and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar. . . . And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. And the angel of the Lord called unto him . . . and he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. . . . And Abraham looked, and behold behind him a rain caught in a thicket . . . and Abra­ham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. . . . And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, by Myself have I sworn, said the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing. . . . I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore . . . .  Genesis 22</p>
<p>THE last wisps of smoke curled upward from the altar on Mount Moriah. Abraham carefully wiped his knife and wrapped it together with the flint in a linen cloth. Isaac stood near him and gazed wistfully at the smold­ering remains of the ram.</p>
<p>"Come, let us go and rejoin the young men," Abraham said when he finished. Isaac did not stir.</p>
<p>"Is there any question in your mind, my son?" Abraham asked kindly, seeing his son's perplexity.</p>
<p>"There is a question in my mind, but I do not know how to ask it."</p>
<p>"Aren't you glad at the turn the event took?"</p>
<p>"I feel glad, Father, yet in my heart I am also downcast."</p>
<p>"Would you rather have been sacrificed as a burnt offering instead of the ram?"</p>
<p>"I do not know, Father. The event has taken place and is no longer to be changed, not ever. Since I have not felt the knife upon my neck, I cannot say with any certainty that I would rather have had it that way. But I am disturbed none-the-less. Was I not chosen for the sacrifice?"</p>
<p>"I was ordered to sacrifice you as a burnt offering."</p>
<p>"And you agreed to do so?"</p>
<p>"It was but a test of my fear and love of God."</p>
<p>"This we know now, but when God spoke to you, 'Take now thy son . . . and offer him' you did not know then that it was merely a test?"</p>
<p>"No, I did not know it then."</p>
<p>"And you would have slaughtered me, your fear and love of God over­coming your love of me?"</p>
<p>"It did not come to pass."</p>
<p>"Of what value, then, is the test that did not test?"</p>
<p>"God looks into the heart of man, and He is satisfied."</p>
<p>"Then you are doubly uncertain, Father, for now neither God nor you may know for a certainty. If He had known your heart, there would have been no need for the test. And you, who are but man, will never know whether your hand would not have faltered and fallen limp before the final stroke of the knife. Indeed, your present gladness that the test had not been consummated leads me to think that it would have happened that way."</p>
<p>"Then feel cheered by the thought that my love for you was greater even than my fear and love of God, for it seemed to me there was a note of blame in your words a moment ago."</p>
<p>"Alas, this cheer, too, is denied me, for though I witnessed your willing­ness to offer me as a sacrifice, I did not have the final proof that you would have drawn back at the last instant."</p>
<p>"Would you have had me disobey the command of God?"</p>
<p>"It is not for me to say. I only observe and am led; therefore I now feel sad, on this account and on still another."</p>
<p>"What else troubles you, my son?" Abraham asked humbly.</p>
<p>"My own part in this act which could have been great yet ended so strangely. During the three days of our journey to Moriah there was great exultation in my heart. I felt as though I was the bridegroom of creation. I was led here; I ascended the altar; then I descended again, and now we are going back to Be'er Sheba. This journey to Moriah has given you sure­ness in your faith and the blessing of God. What has it given me?"</p>
<p>"Have you not also shown your love of both God and me in that you ascended the altar willingly? And is not the blessing conferred equally upon you in that you are my son?"</p>
<p>"I ascended willingly enough, believing I was to be a sacrifice, a burnt offering. I descended whole and untouched, a ram preferred over me—re­jected, like the offering which Cain made and which was refused."</p>
<p>"It could not be otherwise. You are my only son through whom God's blessing is to be fulfilled forever. Feel honored that you were chosen as the burnt offering for Moriah; be glad that the angel stayed my hand. You were not rejected, Isaac; you were only preserved."</p>
<p>"Yet it could have been otherwise," Isaac mused. "He could have ac­cepted the sacrifice, and then restored me to you. Was not my first birth against the rules of nature, considering how I was begotten when you, Father, were old, and Mother was long past the way of women? I therefore prefer to consider what happened today as God's rejection of me. It is better thus, for otherwise my part would be quite meaningless, going to Moriah and back again, even as the horse or the ass journeys here and there not knowing why and for no purpose that concerns it. It is strange to think of it this way, as being chosen and rejected at the same time. And will it always remain this way? Will my offspring also forever remain both chosen and rejected, al­ways mounting altars yet never consummating the immolation? You, Father, are returning from Moriah with a blessing; but I begin to perceive that this journey may yet mean a curse for me and those who issue from me. You say I have been preserved for the fulfillment of your blessing. Now I see your blessing and my curse commingle in the many generations that will come after us. They will indeed be like the stars of heaven and the sand on the shore of the sea in number, but throughout the four corners of the earth they will be called to ascend Moriahs, only to be rejected in the end, thus mixing glory and humiliation."</p>
<p>"Temper your bitterness," Abraham admonished him softly. "In the ardor of your youth you cry out against your rejection, only faintly realiz­ing that chosenness and rejection go hand in hand. I too was chosen for the test, yet not allowed to fulfill it, for its consummation would have meant the end for both you and me. But our kind, the bearers of the blessing and the curse, the glory and the humiliation, go on forever."</p>
<p>Abraham and Isaac descended Mt. Moriah and rejoined their two servants. They loaded the ass and went on their way without speaking. Only the two young men looked at each other meaningfully and engaged in a brief whis­pered conversation.</p>
<p>"The old master looks very aged of a sudden."</p>
<p>"Yes, aged and tired; and Isaac is no longer a boy."</p>

<p class=subtitle>Jacob and Dinah</p>
<p class=ital>And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land . . . and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.</p>
<p class=ital>And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?			Genesis 34</p>
<p>Now that we are in Luz, a day's rapid march from Shechem, I feel some­what more at ease, but not yet entirely so. The terror of God was upon‘ the cities, and they did not pursue us, but we must continue to flee southward, to Mamre, where Father Isaac lives, for by tomorrow the cities about us may regain their spirit and give chase after us for what we have done in Shechem. And then they would destroy us from under God's heaven.</p>
<p>Simeon and Levi, these two stalwart sons of mine, I do not understand them at all. Reuben is hasty and passionate; Judah is troubled and gloomy; Joseph, little Joseph shows signs of being a dreamer. These I can under­stand. But not Simeon and Levi. It is almost as if they did not belong to our family. Were it not that Leah is gentle and subdued, and knows that in my heart I still do not love her despite the many sons she has borne me, I would almost suspect that these two were not begotten by me.</p>
<p>It was a great trouble, of course, and was I not hurt by it as well as they? Is there a father who is not sorely grieved when his daughter, his only daughter is seized upon by the prince of the land and taken to his home and there defiled? Such things do happen, and they are a great sorrow, but the best the victims can do, since they are few in number, is to be silent about it.</p>
<p>And in this case it wasn't even as bad as usual, for though Shechem did defile Dinah, he was anxious to marry her afterward, and he did feel such a great desire for her that he and his father and his entire people were willing to undergo circumcision so that he might marry her in accordance with the Law. Not many would have done as much, and this proved the honesty of his intentions and the nobility of his spirit. So much more reason why the matter should not have been pursued any further.</p>
<p>For, in truth, when everything is considered, it was not such a bad arrange­ment. Now the people of Shechem were circumcised and like us, and Dinah would have become the most honored wife of the prince of the city. What more could we have wished for her than to become the princess of a great and rich city? That she was defiled before her marriage was sad, of course, but in time it would have been forgotten.</p>
<p>I and all the other sons considered it in this light, even gloomy, brooding Judah, but not Simeon and Levi. "Our honor is at stake," they insisted.</p>
<p>But what is honor? And would it have been dishonorable for me to be the father-in-law of the Prince of Shechem, despite the regrettable incident? And then, too, the Shechemites were willing to trade with us and let us live there.</p>
<p>Had I but known what Simeon and Levi planned to do, I would have fled and kept us out of harm's way. But I thought I had persuaded them. I knew that they felt more strongly about what happened to Dinah than all my other sons, yet being my sons I thought they were reconciled when the Shechemites agreed to all our terms. And then, without saying a word of their intentions to me or to any of the brothers, they -slew Shechem and Hamor and looted the city.</p>
<p>"Why have you done this thing?" I cried when they returned, and they answered in such strange words, as if they were not at all children of Jacob who is Israel. "Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?" they said. "Our honor has been besmirched."</p>
<p>It was then that I, who am always mild with my sons, lost my temper. There are many truths that the children of Israel must know if they are to survive, but I always believed in my heart that they would learn these truths in time and that it was not necessary for me to be firm with them. The wisdom that has guided me, and my fathers before me, and has brought us to our present state of prosperity, even if not of complete security, would gradually be learned also by my sons. But now that Simeon and Levi had endangered our survival by their rash and un-Israelite act, and spoken words so alien to the tongue of my people, I was wroth with them. "You speak of honor?" I shouted. "What do you know of honor? Is it the idle notions you have picked up in the field from the Canaanite shepherds, and at the crossroads from the Midianite traders that you call honor? True honor is of the spirit, not of the flesh, as the uncircumcised idolaters believe. What does the flesh know of honor? The flesh knows pleasure and pain; it knows growth and decay; it knows youth and age, life and death. Only the spirit, which lives forever, knows honor and dishonor."</p>
<p>They were crestfallen for a moment, these two violent sons of mine, and I thought I had made them see the light; but I was mistaken, for though their heads were bowed, they muttered the same retort as before: "He has dealt with our sister as with an harlot."</p>
<p>"It is true," I conceded, "Shechem has violated your sister. Were we to live according to the ways of our neighbors who know not the God of Abra­ham, what you have done would have been right and fitting. They live only in the flesh and know not God or the spirit of God, therefore they must avenge in blood all hurt to the flesh. But it is not so with us, especially when some restitution is given us for the wrong inflicted upon us, as Shechem was willing to grant.</p>
<p>"And it is not only I who say this to you. We have a tradition in our family in regard to these matters which we would do well to follow if we are to survive to our appointed triumph at the end of time. Have you not heard, or do you not recall, what Abraham your great-grandfather did in like circum­stances on two occasions? For when he came to Egypt in a time of famine and Pharaoh was tempted by the beauty of your great-grandmother Sarah, he begged her to say that she was not his wife but his sister, imploring her in this fashion to save his life, for Pharaoh would have killed him otherwise. And our father Abraham acted in like manner when he later came to Gerar. Don't you think that our father Abraham loved Sarah, and was concerned for her honor as much as you were concerned for the honor of your sister Dinah? Do you not think that his heart grieved when Sarah was taken to Pharaoh's palace? Or perhaps you two raw youngsters overflowing with strength think that you love honor more than our forefather did?</p>
<p>"And was it not likewise with my father Isaac when he, in his time, came to Gerar? It is true that my mother Rebecca was not taken by the king of Gerar to his palace; but simply anticipating such an eventuality Isaac passed word around that she was his sister and not his wife, lest they molest him on her account.</p>
<p>"Such is the tradition of our family, and who are you to depart from it and bring this danger upon us? Let Esau sneer, and let the Shechemites think of us as they wish; their ways are not our ways; we must keep our eyes on another goal, and move toward a different honor."</p>
<p>But they were not convinced. "We do not know an honor that is both different and far off at the end of time," Simeon said. And Levi added, "We felt not only hurt but also anger at the great injustice. Isn't anger at a great wrong honorable? You speak of survival, but Simeon and I know that if we are to survive, here and now, we must show our neighbors our strength."</p>
<p>It was the foolish pride of youth speaking out of their mouths, and it had to be curbed because it was dangerous. Therefore, before we started on our flight I called all my sons together for a moment and warned them: "Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. . . . Cursed be their anger for it was fierce, and their wrath for it was cruel. . . . For in their anger they killed a man."</p>
<p>I cursed their anger, and they said not a word in reply. But have I con­vinced them? Do they understand now that survival is what matters, sur­vival at all costs, and that one can walk away from what the uncircumcised call dishonor, intent upon the greater honor within? Or will their anger, now cursed and held in check, recoil upon them to torment them?</p>

<p class=subtitle>Ruth's Mother </p>
<p class=ital>And [Naomi] said unto them: Call me not Naomi, call me Marah; for the Almighty hath dealt bitterly with me. Ruth 1</p>
<p>SOMETIMES on clear mornings when the rays of the sun light up the hills of Judah across the Salt Sea, they appear so close that I can almost see Bethlehem on a hillside, and then I imagine I can also see my Ruth walking through its streets. At such times I think that if I were to shout loudly enough, "Ruth, come home; come home to your mother!" she would hear me and return, or at least answer me. But I do not shout to her, and when I do call her, it is without words, only in my heart, for I know she made her choice long ago and cannot hear me any longer.</p>
<p>My Ruth! She is a grown woman and a mother in the land so near yet so remote, but now the story of her life is forever separate from mine, and I can only cling to the memory of my little daughter Ruth. She was such a gay and charming child, so carefree and seemingly thoughtless. Many a time, as she was just beginning to grow into womanhood, I warned my Balak: "She is lighthearted like a breeze. We must look after her well lest this little goat of the fields bring us and herself to grief." But who could have fore­seen that things would turn out as they did!</p>
<p>Now I look back on those days and it seems to me that I had forebodings of the events that followed. I well recall the day Elimelech, Naomi and their two sons stopped at our house on their way from famine-stricken Judah. I disliked Naomi at the first glance. She, a fugitive from a dry land without bread, a guest in our house and land, was so disdainful and haughty even her courteous words failed to conceal her pride. "This woman has come to inherit you," the thought then passed through my mind. And when my Balak bid them enter and wash their feet and rest, I felt like crying to him: "Let these people go on their way! I do not want them in my house! They are the bearers of grief for this household!" But I did not say these words. They were guests and we had our duty to do by them, and had I spoken, Balak would not have listened to me. In our land one does not turn away the stranger.</p>
<p>And then things happened quickly, and I saw their meaning yet was mute, for there was naught I could say that might not have sounded foolish or wrong. I gave them bread and meat, as Balak told me to, hoping they would eat and go on their way; and they would have been welcome and more than welcome to the meal had they but thanked us and departed. But Elimelech was a man of wealth, and Naomi a woman of pride, and after they had finished eating, and after they had said all the courteous things one says on such occasions, Elimelech opened his purse, full of gold and silver coins and bracelets and rings, and offered to pay us for the repast. Balak refused to take money. It is not the custom in our land to take money for food offered to strangers, but I saw the gleam in his eyes. He was a good man, my hus­band Balak, but the truth must be told, he did love gold and silver; and though he refused to take money as payment for the meal, he gladly assented when Elimelech called Ruth and placed a precious bracelet on her arm. And then things could not have happened otherwise than they did. We had to ask them to stay for a few days and they readily agreed, for where had they to go? The stay was prolonged, they showered presents on Ruth, and Balak urged them to remain until the famine was over in Judah.</p>
<p>Had I listened to the dark whispers of my heart I might still have kept Ruth, for there were many occasions when I could have asked them to leave, once the duties of Moabite hospitality had been fulfilled. But I must now admit it was not my Balak's greed that stood in the way—I could have over­come that readily enough. It was Naomi herself who prevented me. I had learned to fear her without myself knowing why. She was gracious in man­ner, and her speech was kind, yet it was not long before I began to quake in her presence as if I, a daughter of one of the best families in Moab, and married to Balak, a descendant of Moab's greatest king, were a mere servant girl.</p>
<p>Oh, that famine in Judah! How I prayed that it pass and our guests re­turn to their home! But year followed year and the hillsides of Judah re­mained parched, and every summer saw a new stream of people making their way eastward to the towns of Moab. Elimelech, Naomi and their two sons stayed. In time they bought a house near ours and we became neigh­bors. I must say they were fine people and they wronged no one and there was nothing anyone could say to blame them. In my heart all that time I felt the great wrong coming, yet had I spoken of it I would have been scorned.</p>
<p>I saw it coming long before it happened. Many a time at the end of a hot afternoon Elimelech came to chat with Balak on the threshing floor. I dreaded his errand, so much so indeed that when the blow finally came it was no surprise to me. "Elimelech wants our Ruth as wife for his older son Mahlon," Balak told me that evening over our meat. My breath stopped for I knew what Balak answered him even before he told me. "Elimelech is a good man, and a wealthy one, and of a noble family in his land," Balak said. "I therefore told him we would deem it an honor to be joined with his fam­ily." "But they are strangers," I could not help crying out. "They come from a land which, though not far, is foreign. They do not worship Chemosh. And when the famine in Judah passes they will depart and take our Ruth, our only daughter, with them and we may never see her again."</p>
<p>But Balak seemed not to hear me. Who knows? Maybe I had not cried out at all. Maybe it only seemed to me that I had cried out. For Balak said: "Elimelech is offering fine gifts for the bride." And what more could I do, since I am but a woman and Balak had given his word.</p>
<p>There was a wedding, a very fine wedding, and guests from far and near, and there were two altars, one for Jehovah and one for Chemosh, with sacri­fices at both. I did not mind it. We in Moab believe that everyone should go in the name of his god. It was Naomi who inspired me with fear. She sat among the women, the only Judean among the Moabites, and there was that much pride in her face as if she had been a queen.</p>
<p>Strange things happened a short time later. Elimelech died, my son-in-law Mahlon died, his brother Chilion died. I am ashamed to admit it, but while everybody mourned and wailed there was a song in my heart. Now Ruth would remain with me forever. Naomi might go back to Bethlehem or stay in Moab; it was all the same to me. Now I was sure of one thing—Ruth would not go away. She would marry again, this time some fine Moabite man in the neighborhood, and I would have her near me and I would be nurse to her children and my old days would be gladdened. And you should have seen Naomi at this time! All her pride seemed to have gone out of her. I almost ceased, fearing her, and even pitied her at times. I should have known better. There was strength in that woman that we in Moab do not possess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end she took my Ruth away from me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two years ago a traveler went by this way and we invited him into the house. Our life was dull now and our thoughts were sad, so we welcomed mo­mentary diversion, the tale of a traveler, stories from afar. He came from a distant land in the North, he said, and he was on his way to the land of the two rivers in the East. Some days before he had passed through the land of Judah and had stopped to rest in Bethlehem. "They tell a strange tale in Bethlehem," he said, "a very strange tale indeed, about a woman from Moab. The whole town is talking about it."</p>
<p>I knew at once my Ruth was in that story. My face must have told on me, for Balak looked sternly at me to warn me; so I said nothing. "And what is the strange story about a Moabite woman that people tell in Bethlehem?" Balak asked with pretended unconcern.</p>
<p>"They tell of a young woman of Moab who married the son of a man of Judah who had sojourned in her land, and then her husband and her father-in-law died, but rather than stay with her parents and her people she fol­lowed her mother-in-law to Bethlehem. The mother-in-law, a woman named Naomi, indeed entreated her to remain at home, but the young woman of Moab declared, 'Whither thou goest, I will go. . . . Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.' "</p>
<p>"Is that all the woman of Moab said?" I asked the man.</p>
<p>"That's what they tell in Bethlehem," he answered, "and they praise her highly for her devotion."</p>
<p>That's what they tell in Bethlehem; but that was not all my Ruth had said. I knew that. For the night before she departed with Naomi I lay at her feet crying and begging her not to abandon me in my old age. "You are my child, my only child," I cried. "And wherein am I worse than Naomi that you should leave me and cleave to her? You are my child, and now that her son is dead she is a stranger to you in every way."</p>
<p>But my Ruth, gentle, gracious Ruth, denied me. "I am indeed your daughter," she said, "but a child no longer. I have known a man, and the grief of losing a man, and now I must go, for though Mahlon is dead I now belong to his people, and Naomi is a mother to me."</p>
<p>"It is also told in Bethlehem," the traveler continued, "that when Naomi returned people wondered at her appearance and cried out: 'Is this Naomi!' and she replied, 'Call me not Naomi, call me Marah, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.' "</p>
<p>"She is a vain and false woman, this Naomi!" I could not help crying out. The traveler was amazed at my outburst and Balak motioned me to be silent. But how could I help saying what I did? Naomi an embittered woman indeed! She drew my only daughter after herself to console her in her old age, leaving me alone, a dry old woman without child or grandchild.</p>
<p>"And Ruth is again married," the traveler told us, "to a man named Boaz and she has a little son."</p>
<p>"What is the name of this Moabite woman's little son?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Does it matter?" the man answered in puzzlement. "Enough that it is a strange and wondrous story and ended so marvelously well for all con­cerned." But seeing my distressed eagerness he did mention that the boy was named Obed.</p>
<p>Does it matter! Could anything matter more? And now I knew I was a grandmother, and that my little grandson, Ruth's son, was named Obed. But daughter and grandson were alike so unattainable. The story of Ruth had no place in it for Ruth's mother, not one word of the abandoned mother.</p>
<p>"More they say in Bethlehem," the traveler continued. "A strange thing they tell, that a great king and redeemer of mankind, one they call Messiah, will some day be born from the offspring of this Moabite woman and her husband. It is a legend in his tribe, and they all believe it in Bethlehem."</p>
<p>Perhaps the traveler told other things, I do not know, for at this I left the house and cried. What matters to me this strange story of a Messiah to come out of Judah! It is my Ruth I need, it is her little Obed that I want to take to my bosom, to be consoled and refreshed by her goodness and by the tender­ness of his childish face. Let them have their Messiah from their own kin, if only mine were returned to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story of the traveler troubles me very much. A year ago my Balak died and I was left alone. Then I decided that, happen what may, I would again see Ruth and also her little son. I would go to Judah. It is really not very far, down the hills to the Jordan, and then up into the hills—difficult for an old woman, but not impossible. But to this day I haven't begun my journey, and with every passing day it becomes more difficult and less likely. Why don't I start out? I don't know the true answer myself. Somehow I am afraid. No, neither the hardships of the trip nor its dangers stop me. I know that almost any day I could join a camel caravan going west, and in their kindness the people of the caravan might even have pity on my age and let me ride one of their beasts. I am afraid of other things. I fear Naomi's bitter pride, which in her triumph must have grown still greater. Even more I am afraid of what my Ruth, now no longer mine, might think. She was always a good daughter, and I am sure she would receive me kindly. But might she not look at me as at a stranger, and in her heart think: "Who is this Moabite woman and what does she want of me, now that I am a mother in Judah and from my womb has come he who will be the progenitor of the Messiah?" This I fear, to be doubly denied, and probably this is why I never started on my journey, and never will.</p>
<p>But when on clear mornings I look at the hills of Judah, I can almost see my lost Ruth walking through the streets of Bethlehem, proudly carrying in her arms her little son Obed, my little grandson Obed. It is then I feel like crying to her over the hills: "Ruth! Return to me, Ruth!"</p>
