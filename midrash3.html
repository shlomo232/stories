<p class=subtitle>Rachel's Lament</p>
<p class=ital>. . . and Jacob did so and fulfilled her [Leah's1 week and he [Laban] gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also ... and he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah ... and when the Lord saw Leah was hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren. Genesis 30</p>
<p>"Now you see?" Laban said to Jacob at the end of the day's festivities, marking Jacob's wedding to Rachel. "You have been given what is due you. and even more, for the seven years of servitude which you owe me for Rachel are still unnerved. and already you are about to go into the bridal chamber with her. I trust you that you will serve me well. Yet you were so hasty as to accuse me of dishonest dealing when a week ago I substituted Leah for Rachel in the bridal chamber."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I was hasty when I cried out against the substitution," Jacob said. "I did not know the customs of this land. But. dear father—for since I am a stranger in this land you are like a Father to me—vou should have warned me that you could not give me Rachel before her older sister. I may then have waited till you had given Leah in marriage to another man. But as things happened. can you not imagine how I felt when I awoke in the morning one week ago, satiated and ful­filled and overflowing with manly pride, and I opened the curtain a little to let in some light, for I wanted to look at Rachel my wife. It had all been planned carefully in my mind during the seven years that I served you, and. unknown to you, Rachel and I met secretly many times and talked of our wedding night. Everything was worked out to the last detail, every second before the complete fulfillment was ac­counted for. But Rachel and I had made one great mistake in our plan—in our fantasies of our wedding night we made no allowance for speech of any kind. In the darkness only our hands and our bodies were to speak for us. If only we had arranged some secret word of recogni­tion to be whispered, then this grave trouble could not have arisen, for then I would have known at once that it was Leah I was with.</p>
<p>"And we also had agreed well in advance that when morning broke I was to awake and, letting in a little light into our bridal chamber, I was to uncover Rachel and behold her beauty entirely even while she slept in happiness, only touching her lightly here and there to make sure that both she and I were real.</p>
<p>"Do you wonder then why I cried out when I saw that it was Leah I had given my love to all that cursed night, not knowing what I was doing. I cried out, but it was not your honesty that I questioned; it was mine that was in doubt."</p>
<p>Laban looked at Jacob slyly and winked. "Very well, my son, very well. I will consider this an adequate apology. though I don't quite understand everything you said. How was your honesty involved? I don't understand this. But, in any case, now that you are a man who has known a woman I can talk to you as to an equal. Your sentiments are very fine, of course. even though I don't understand some of them. So here is my advice to you. Act like a grown man and don't babble like a half-grown boy. You have had Leah. Now you are going in to Rachel. Enjoy both of them, and don't feel troubled. and serve me well the next seven years even as you did the first seven years.</p>
<p>"Go now, go," Laban added as Jacob remained standing before him in perplexity. "Aren't you eager to discover the charms of my younger daughter whom you say you love so much?" And Laban burst out in ribald laughter.</p>
<p>Jacob stealthily made his way through the hilarious and drunken company. Their jests as they encouraged him to prove himself with a second woman in eight days annoyed him. One week earlier. when he walked through the big room crowded with guests he blushed at their sallies but did not resent them, for even in their coarseness he found them not fundamentally unlike his fantasies about Rachel. Now he nodded to one and to another in order not to seem rude. He even smiled self-consciously at some coarse suggestion and tried to pass by the joker quickly, but this only aroused more comment. "Look. he's bashful," one of the drunken guests shouted. "Like a virgin," another guest added his own comment. "Could he have done wrong by our Leah?" someone asked.</p>
<p>But at last Jacob was through this ordeal, and only two old men were with him, escorting him to the door of the bridal chamber which was guarded by two matrons. These old men did not speak to him on the way, either seriously or in jest, and only when they left him at the door did they repeat the formula prescribed for the occasion, and then they departed, and the two matrons followed after them.</p>
<p>Jacob confidently made his way to the couch of rugs and pillows in the corner where Rachel lay. He did not have to grope in the dark for he remembered the room only too well from the preceding week with Leah. He stopped before the couch and called softly, "Rachel."</p>
<p>Rachel did not answer.</p>
<p>Jacob sat down on the couch and stroked her hair. "Our time has finally come." he whispered to her, "after seven endless years which now seem no more than a day. I would have served and waited for you seven times seven years, and done so gladly. Turn to me. love."</p>
<p>But instead of turning to him, Rachel became convulsed with sob­bing.</p>
<p>"Why do you weep?" Jacob bent over her tenderly. "Why do you weep? Though I think I know why, and it is good that you do. I could almost weep myself, thinking of the seven lost years; and also in ecstasy at the hours before us. Do you remember all the plans we had made for this night during the years?"</p>
<p>"And haven't you brought a light with you?" Rachel suddenly spoke amid her hysterical sobbing.</p>
<p>"A light?" Jacob was puzzled. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>Rachel's sobbing stopped just as suddenly as it had begun and her voiced hissed in the darkness with poorly suppressed rage. "A light, of course. Flint and a piece of metal to strike it with, and a sliver of kindling to catch the spark and burst into flame."</p>
<p>"What are you saying?" Jacob exclaimed and there was a note of terror in his voice. "What for do we want a light on the night of our wedding in our bridal chamber?"</p>
<p>"To make certain that you are with the right woman," Rachel answered and again burst into violent weeping.</p>
<p>Jacob sat up with a start as if he had been stung by an adder. and then his entire body seemed to collapse within itself. For a while he was silent and when he finally spoke all he could say was to repeat: "There is only one Rachel; there is only one Rachel; you are Rachel."</p>
<p>"Except when it is dark, of course," she jeered amid her tears. "When darkness descends, every woman becomes Rachel, even that weak-eyed sister of mine."</p>
<p>"Don't say this, don't say it. it is not so." Jacob pleaded. "There is only one Rachel in the world for me, and you are Rachel, my lamb, my ewe."</p>
<p>"Then how could you, how could you," Rachel wailed. "How could you be an entire night with that sister of mine and never once know the difference? Did you not touch the coarseness of her hair? Did you not feel the heavy fatness of her arms about you? And when you kissed her nipples, as was agreed between us, could you not tell at once that it was not I? That you had to search for them somewhere along her belly or on the pillows beside her?"</p>
<p>Rachel burst into uncontrolled tears, and all Jacob did was to repeat, "It is not so; it was not so; it was not as you think; it was not as you say."</p>
<p>"Then how was it if it was not so?" Rachel challenged.</p>
<p>"I thought it was you all the time. In my mind it was you all night; and when the light of day broke into the chamber, I cried out bitterly, as you well know."</p>
<p>Rachel's sobbing subsided and after some moments she asked in a whisper, "You loved Leah during the hours of darkness, did you not?"</p>
<p>"I loved you," Jacob insisted. "There is only one Rachel."</p>
<p>"And did you find much pleasure and gladness in Leah?"</p>
<p>"I did," Jacob confessed, and added quickly, "but only because I believed it was you."</p>
<p>"Then you loved her, not me," Rachel cut him short. "You were with her, you found joy in her, and you gave your love to her. Does it matter what you thought? Were it not for our speech now, you might think that I am Leah and hate me. It would seem," she added, "that in dark thought every woman can become Rachel. Then who is Rachel? A thought and no more. I am merely an image in your mind, and when you close your eyes, or the light is put out. every other woman can assume my image for you. Then go back to Leah whom you have already loved and in whom you found joy. And if your mind troubles you on my account. because of the love you have sworn to me for seven years. then all you have to do is think of me. Go then!" she screamed.</p>
<p>"It is not so, it is not so." Jacob repeated mechanically, barely knowing what he was saying, clinging to these words as to a last refuge. while Rachel's body shook with sobs.</p>
<p class=subtitle>Jacob—Israel</p>
<p class=ital>And he said unto him: "What is thy name?" And he said: "Jacob." And he said: "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast striven with God and with men and hast prevailed." Genesis 32.</p>
<p>IT WAS a busy twenty-four hours for Jacob. perhaps the busiest in his entire life. In later years he often marvelled at the strange events that befell him then and that so profoundly influenced all the rest of his life. And whenever he thought back to that day he glowed with pride at some of the things that happened and he also blushed with shame at some of the others.</p>
<p>The sequence of events on that fateful day began long before dawn, shortly after midnight in fact. Jacob was busy moving his entire camp across the ford of Yabbok. True, Yabbok is not a big river. Per­haps one shouldn't even call it a river, but only a brook. In the land of the Two Rivers whence Jacob had fled so recently, a stream such as Yabbok would have passed unnoticed and probably would not have been honored with a name. But here it was, flowing between its steep banks and presenting quite an obstacle with its swift rivulets dashing among the boulders. Esau had to be met the next day and God alone knew how that dreaded encounter was to end. It was out of the question to wait for daylight before moving the camp across the stream. Worried over the meeting with his brother who approached accom­panied by four hundred men of war, Jacob moved his four wives, their children and all he had with him across Yabbok. Then he went back alone to the site of the abandoned camp. It is not quite clear why he went back. Some say that he had left there a few small vessels. Perhaps. In his distraught state of mind this was possible. In any case, there he was, alone on the far bank of Yabbok, and the morning star had just risen when he was challenged by—and here is mystery. Jacob was not sure who it was that challenged him. Darkness was still upon the land and images were blurred so that one could not tell a wolf from a dog. One might say that it was a man, an ordinary human being. perhaps even a robber bent on plunder. Yet it was not an ordinary man either. This became evident from the manner in which he wrestled with Jacob. And how is one to know when one's opponent is simply a man or some superhuman messenger, perhaps even an angel? Hadn't Jacob's grandfather. Abraham, entertained angels or messengers of God who had seemed to be men and even seemed to consume food like human beings?</p>
<p>Jacob fought this creature of the pre-dawn and neither could van­quish the other. And. strangely, when the first light of dawn began to break, this creature who seemed to be man became panicky and pleaded: "Let me go for the day breaketh." This was Jacob's clue to his advantage and he was not one to miss his opportunity. He de­manded that he be blessed by his opponent as the price of releasing him, and the blessing consisted in the change of his name from Jacob to Israel—one who has striven with God and has prevailed.</p>
<p>Jacob was pleased with the blessing. It was unlike any he had received before. He knew that he bore the blessing of becoming the progenitor of offspring numerous as the sand on the shore of the sea, and he also enjoyed the blessing of wealth. But striving with God and prevailing over Him, this was indeed a unique and unexpected honor; and it was bought so cheaply—at the cost of a strained thigh.</p>
<p>By the time the man-God had left and Jacob rejoined his camp on the other side of Yabbok, daylight was over the land, and there were many things to do, and still more things to worry about. But it was not in Jacob's character to let the events of the pre-dawn wait for a more suitable occasion. No sooner did he reach his camp than he called together his wives and their children and all the servants who were with him and briefly informed them that henceforth he was to be called Israel, the man who had striven with and prevailed over God and man.</p>
<p>They accepted this announcement as a matter of fact. They had known Jacob long enough not to be surprised by anything he said or did. One thing they had learned about him—that whatever happened to him, or whatever he said happened to him. would be grandiose and would somehow involve God. Now that he announced his change of name and that he had overcome God, only Rachel and Leah, Jacob's two chief wives dared shake their heads ever so slightly. Rachel also permitted herself a slight smile of bitterness and resentment though, of course, she said nothing. But in her head a thought that went back to the time of her marriage rankled briefly. "If Jacob could not tell Leah from Rachel in the dark of the bridal chamber, when he was much younger and when his passions were involved, how could he tell that the creature with whom he had wrestled in the night was not simply a desert bandit? And as for prevailing over his opponent—well, there was no telling in what condition Jacob had left his opponent, but he himself was limping badly from a strained thigh."</p>
<p>Such were Rachel's thoughts. Leah too shook her head at Jacob's announcement, but the nod of her head was maternal rather than disparaging. She neither believed nor disbelieved Jacob's story. It did not matter much to her what he said. One thing she knew—love talk she would not hear from him. She had never quite understood him. He was a strange child-man, full of incomprehensible dreams and ideas. But he had fathered many sons on her and she was content in her role of obedient wife. If he now wanted to be called Israel, well then, she would call him Israel—if only he were to spend more time with her and perhaps beget more sons with her.</p>
<p>In any case, there was not much time for speculation about the new name. Esau was only a hill or two away, and though the lavish present for Esau had already gone ahead—the camels and the goats and the bulls and the asses—still, there was no telling whether he would be mollified by it. And why, if his intentions were peaceful, did he come with four hundred men? Was that a way to come to meet a brother?</p>
<p>Thus Jacob, despite his new name, was very busy arranging matters for any possible eventuality. being careful that Esau should see the handmaidens and their children first, and Leah and her sons next. leaving Rachel and Joseph hindmost—just in case Esau planned some kind of calamity.</p>
<p>But things turned out well, much better than Jacob had hoped for. Esau ran up to him and they embraced and kissed and wept. Every­thing proceeded beautifully, and then they sat down and talked as brothers do. Jacob introduced his family, and Esau pretended that he did not know that the flocks which had preceded the camp were a present for him. All was done in good form and in accordance with the requirements of curtesy.</p>
<p>It was only after the formalities were finished that the conversation became more direct and intimate. The two brothers sat apart on their mats, their camp followers staying some distance away. Jacob felt re­assured that there was no immediate danger, and Esau permitted him­self a sly remark: "I see," he said, "that my little brother has done well during the years that he was away."</p>
<p>Jacob resented the slight but his answer was tempered with pru­dence. He said: "I am your little brother indeed, though also the owner of the birthright of the first-born. You recall, I am sure, the mess of pottage for which you sold it to me."</p>
<p>"Yes, I recall it. well," Esau answered barely suppressing a flood of anger. "And I flatter myself that I am responsible in two ways for your prosperity, first by selling you my birthright, and secondly by causing you to flee to Laban where you amassed your wealth. I feel so responsi­ble for your prosperity that I almost like to consider your wealth my own."</p>
<p>Seeing that Jacob was distressed and frightened by this remark, Esau reassured him. He winked slyly in the direction of his four hun­dred armed men and said pointedly: "Do not be alarmed, my younger brother. I have enough of my own. Keep what you have."</p>
<p>But seeing Jacob reassured, Esau returned to the assault. "Brother," he said condescendingly, "let us not talk of such small matters as flocks and wealth. We both have enough, and it is also not necessary at this time to rake old and cold ashes about who is the true owner of the first-born's birthright and how genuine the claim of each of us to it. But I have heard this morning that you have changed your name, that you now call yourself Israel and claim to have striven with God and overcome him."</p>
<p>"It is true," Jacob answered in a low voice.</p>
<p>"This is marvellous," Esau declared ironically and Jacob lowered his head. "Then you are not afraid of anyone?" Esau persisted. "Also not of me?" and he again winked in the direction of the four hundred men.</p>
<p>Jacob was silent.</p>
<p>"It is a strange thing," Esau mused. "Our father, Isaac, is afraid of God. Our grandfather, Abraham, talked to God as a man speaks to a man. But you say that you contended with God, and overcame him, too. Tell me, how did it come about?"</p>
<p>"It happened in the night, last night," Jacob said softly, his eyes lowered.</p>
<p>"Did God come upon you in a great flame, or with thunder, or how did it happen?"</p>
<p>"He came upon me as a man, and we wrestled."</p>
<p>"Are you sure it was not an ordinary man?"</p>
<p>"I am sure."</p>
<p>"I do not mean to doubt your word, little brother, knowing you always as a man of great honesty and unquestioned integrity, but is it not possible that, let us say, you made a mistake in the dark? This sometimes happens, and I have heard say that you once made a mistake in the dark," Esau said and burst out in rude laughter.</p>
<p>"There was no mistake this time," Jacob said. "The one I contended with blessed me and gave me my new name."</p>
<p>"Then you are not afraid of anyone now?" Esau repeated his former question.</p>
<p>"I am afraid," Jacob conceded.</p>
<p>"How is this possible?"</p>
<p>"It is difficult, almost impossible to explain, brother," Jacob's voice became a whisper. "A man may strive and contend with God in the night, and prevail over him, yet be afraid during the day, afraid of many things."</p>
<p>Esau looked at him blankly and said in a conciliating tone: "Let us not quarrel, little brother who has prevailed. You tell the truth when you say you are afraid. This I can see plainly. Perhaps you also tell the truth about what happened at night. I am a hunter and a warrior, a man of daylight, but I know that strange things happen in the night. I have heard their sounds sometimes in the Mountain of Seir. So I will not dispute with you; though, little brother, I find it hard to imagine you as a battler against God, and a winner to boot. I remember how quickly you fled after that trick you played on me many years ago. How you did run, ha ha ha! And Mama had to help you! Come, come now," he added seeing Jacob's crestfallen expression and slapped him on the back. "Let's forget bygones. I have forgiven you long ago. But all the same, this last one, about you becoming Israel—this is a good one. And now what would you have of me? Will you come with me to Seir? I will welcome you there. As your older brother I tell you I will. Or should I leave some of my men to go with you? You know," Esau grinned devilishly, "the countryside isn't too safe, and though you have vanquished God, how will you do against an armed gang?" And again he burst into loud laughter.</p>
<p>Thus they parted and Jacob felt relieved when the interview with Esau ended and his brother together with his four hundred men took the road southward. He returned to his camp at noontime where he was eagerly awaited by everyone. His momentary discomfiture by Esau's raw remarks which had caused him to lower both his head and his voice gave way to a sense of elation. He had triumphed again. The victories were coming fast on the heels of each other. First Laban pur­sued him and was persuaded to make peace, then there was the mysteri­ous encounter in the night which had given him a proud new name and identity, and hours after that came the victory over Esau whom he had feared more than all the others.</p>
<p>As he entered his encampment the glow of pride on his face could be read by all his retainers and they breathed more easily knowing that the danger had passed, but none dared ask Jacob what had happened though all wanted to know. It was not till some hours later, when the evening meal was served to him, that Jacob called Leah and Rachel to join him in his tent. For some time they sat in silence waiting for him to finish his meal. And when he had finished and had dipped his fingers into the bowl which a servant had brought him and still said nothing. Rachel opened the conversation with a question.</p>
<p>"Your brother Esau has departed without doing us harm. Will you not tell us how you persuaded him to go, Israel our husband?"</p>
<p>"That I will gladly do, and it was in order to tell you that I invited you to be present here. It was a terrifying experience, for my brother Esau had come here with his army to destroy us. Seeking an alibi to attack us he accused me of having cheated him of his birthright and he claimed that all I had was his. But I was not afraid of him and I offered him the choice of peace as more fitting between brothers, especially since. . . . But he had already heard of my exploit last night and that I was no longer Jacob, the one who flees all the time, and therefore he wisely chose the peace I offered him and departed home."</p>
<p>"And you were not afraid at all?" Rachel exclaimed and there was mockery in her voice. Leah made frantic signs to her to be silent, fearful of Jacob's anger, but Rachel disregarded these and continued, "Yet you gave him all those rich presents."</p>
<p>"The presents I gave him because he is my brother, and I have much left and will have that much more," Jacob answered curtly.</p>
<p>"Israel, you are great among the men of the earth," Rachel exclaimed mockingly, as Leah wrung her hands nervously at the possible outcome of such a conversation. From her own experience she knew the deva­stating sweep of Jacob's wrath which Rachel now seemed to be fanning. "I am your husband, and that should suffice for you, whether I am great among men or not," Jacob retorted. "Also bear in mind that I have bested your father, wrestled with God, and this day I have saved all of you from the sword of my brother Esau. That is enough. Whether I was afraid or not does not matter, And now," he concluded and by rising himself gave them the sign that they were to go, "it is best that you retire to your tents for tomorrow we must start early toward Schechem."</p>
<p>On the way to their tents Leah chided Rachel for her behavior. "You have angered him, and he is our lord and husband," she said.</p>
<p>"Israel," Rachel said aloud speaking to herself. "If he is like a God, or even mightier than one, why could he not give me sons? When I asked him for a son lest I die, he flew into one of his rages and said, `Am I then in the place of God?' "</p>
<p>"Do not complain," Leah pleaded with her. "Now you have a son, Joseph, and moreover, Jacob loves you. It is you he loves to this day, whereas I, despite all the sons I bore him, am barely tolerated."</p>
<p>"That he loves me I know," Rachel conceded, "only he is a man of dreams and in his dreams at night, his love, his God, and he himself sometimes get inextricably mixed up so that even he cannot tell where dream ends and reality begins. You know this, sister," she hissed toward Leah and without another word went into her tent.</p>
<p>On his couch of skins in his own tent Jacob mused with some bitter­ness. "They do not understand. Not one of them understands, excepting Rachel possibly, and she is bitter against me ever since the night of my marriage to Leah. It seems impossible for them to understand that one can strive with God as man strives with man and gain the upper hand yet know fear. 'Was I not afraid of Esau?' she asked. As if she did not know. Of course I was afraid of Esau, even as formerly I was afraid of Laban. I am afraid of many things. I am a man of many fears. Yet it is possible to be afraid of small things but strive with the great ones. They all think so simply. If a man is not afraid of an unarmed man, he will be afraid of one armed. And if he is not afraid of one armed man, he will be afraid of ten armed men. If he is not afraid of the jackal, he will be afraid of the lion. A symmetrical hierarchy of fears. This is how Esau thinks. This is how Leah thinks when she thinks, for being a simple woman she is not given much to thought. But I know that it is possible to be afraid of the snarling stray dog on the outskirts of the camp yet to be able to strive with man and even with God and to prevail. They cannot understand this, hence they laugh at me as much as they dare. But I know it to be true, the truth, and I will proclaim it everywhere that I am Jacob-Israel. I am Israel.</p>
<p class=subtitle>Rachel's Death</p>
<p class=ital>And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath; and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath. . . . Genesis 48.</p>
<p>THE ENTIRE encampment was in turmoil. They had been marching steadily southward. They were no more than a day's march from Hebron, which was also known as Mamre or Arbah, the abode of Isaac, or perhaps two days if one were to proceed very slowly. There they were to stop, not permanently, for they never stopped anywhere permanently, but at least for some time. They all longed for the rest in store for them. It had been a long journey from Padan and one beset with many adventures. Now a resting place was almost within sight. And just then Rachel went into labor and Jacob ordered a halt. This was not unexpected. Jacob would not leave Rachel with some servants and a midwife and proceed with the rest of his followers. The final lap of the journey would have to wait.</p>
<p>Jacob retired to his tent to await word of the birth of Rachel's child. All the others gathered in little clusters and ominously whispered among themselves, for it became apparent very soon that Rachel's labor was not proceeding normally. The midwife, it is true, sent out frequent word by her helpers that all was going well, merely a somewhat pro­tracted labor. And to Rachel, too, she said: "Fear not, thou shalt have this son also." But then everyone knew that midwives, like doctors, had to be cheerful and to encourage their patients.</p>
<p>The groups of people whispered among themselves, but as the hours passed and Rachel was not delivered, they ceased whispering and merely shrugged their shoulders meaningfully. Thus the hours dragged on until the news finally flashed through the camp: Rachel has given birth to a son; she named him Benoni—son of my sorrow; Rachel died. Everybody tiptoed away meantime casting apprehensive glances in the direction of Jacob's tent.</p>
<p>No one told Jacob that Rachel died. There was no one who dared to. But Jacob knew. He knew that Rachel died; he also knew that the child was born alive. It was natural that he should know. Jacob had the habit of holding long obsessive mental discussions with himself whenever he was under any mental or emotional strain, which was nearly all the time. He held such discussions—arguments, rather—with himself justifying his own behavior, with God with whom his conten­tions were not limited to that night before he met his brother Esau, with other people with whom he was involved in one way or another. When Rachel went into labor and Jacob isolated himself in his tent to await the outcome, he almost at once entered compulsively into a long discussion with her. He was under great strain and fearful of the outcome. He felt guilty, sensing that because of the interminable argu­ment—though often without words—which had gone on between him and her ever since that first night in their bridal chamber, he harbored a resentment against her and might secretly have wished that she fail in the birth of her second son or even that she die in her labor. On the other hand, he also knew that he loved her very much, as much as on the day he first saw her, and that her death or failure would also mean his own failure and at least partial death.</p>
<p>While he was thus engaged in his endless argument, his ear was alive to every murmur that came from outside. He was familiar with the least sounds of the camp and any change in their rhythm at once impressed itself upon his brain. He heard the shuffling of the people as they moved about whispering and comparing opinions and hopes. He heard the special sounds that came from Rachel's tent—her occasional outcries, the call of the midwife ordering her assistants to do one thing or another. When the people quietly fled to their tents and an oppressive silence set in, only broken by the discordant braying of an ass or the baying of a dog, he became aware of it at once and correctly interpreted it to mean that Rachel had died. He also knew that the newborn child was alive because of the frequent calls of the midwife urging her helpers to be quick about their duties.</p>
<p>Jacob left his tent and went to see Rachel. Many eyes watched him furtively but no one said a word to him. Some of the people were quietly packing their belongings. convinced that Jacob would soon order the tents struck so that Rachel's body could be taken to Hebron for internment in the Cave of Machpelah, the family burial vault which Abraham had bought when Sarah died. Only when he entered the tent where Rachel lay was Jacob confronted by the midwife who held out the infant to him. He looked at the child without apparent concern and declared almost casually. "I will call him Benjamin—the son of my right hand." "His mother named him Benoni just before she died," the midwife said, but seeing the expression of remoteness in Jacob's eyes, as if he had not heard her, she retreated from before him and nodded to her helpers to leave the tent together with her. Jacob was left alone with Rachel.</p>
<p>For some time he looked at Rachel's uncovered face. Distorted with agony a short while before. her face had quickly relaxed into an expression of calm repose and had not yet assumed that special pallor which distinguishes the dead and removes them from communication with the living. Whether he actually spoke to her or merely thought the words which he later remembered, he could not recall. But after looking at the familiar beloved features for some time. he said, "Now the conflict between us is ended." He paused for a while, since these opening words unleashed an almost incoherent torrent in his mind, and then he continued, "Now the conflict is in my mind alone. I have loved you. Rachel, from the first moment that I saw you at the well. And you have loved me. But you could never forgive me the error of my first night with Leah. I, in turn, could never forgive you your resentment. I was innocent, and in my innocence I erred. Had I loved you less that error could not have taken place. I would not have been so impatient. I would not have been so blinded—for I was blinded then by the belief that it was you to whom I was led. Reality vanished; there was only the thought: 'I am going to Rachel; after seven years' waiting I am going to my beloved.' So overwhelmed was I with this knowledge that no doubt could enter my mind. You were to be in the bridal chamber waiting for me, and had your father Laban substituted not Leah but a veritable log of wood, I would not have known the differ­ence considering the state of ecstasy I was in.</p>
<p>"You knew this, yet you could not forgive me. Though you wanted me to be in ecstasy at the impending consummation of our love, you also seemed to have expected me to act like a merchant in the market­place who examines the merchandise he buys lest he be cheated, whereas I could not then believe that anyone could deal falsely, for true love, such as I felt for you, knows and tolerates no falseness or even the thought of the existence of falsehood. In my great exultation I became a bridegroom ravished. Nor is this such a unique occurrence either among men or among women who in the great generosity induced by their happiness sometimes blindly lavish themselves on anyone who is mean enough to take advantage of their state of thoughtless bliss.</p>
<p>"Such was the case. I too did not forgive myself my error nor did I ever become reconciled to my loss. But since the error was mine in the beginning. I reached out to you hoping that in your understanding you would forgive me that which I could not forgive myself. But you, like me, wanted perfection, and feeling that you had been deprived of it even in the least degree, you turned against me. And now it was my turn to resent your anger, and not to forgive you for it, since it caused me double punishment—that which I inflicted on myself and that which you inflicted on me.</p>
<p>"This rejection in the midst of love I became aware of soon, and a great fear came upon me—a justified fear, as it turned out—that it would last as long as we lived. For such seems to be the way of thinking of our kind. Thus my father Isaac felt when he was chosen and then rejected as a sacrifice. Thus our forefather Adam felt when he was driven out of Eden for a slight disobedience committed in a moment of thoughtlessness.</p>
<p>"We loved one another, Rachel. Ours is perhaps the first and cer­tainly the greatest love between man and woman, and this unforgivingness between us may cast a pall on the loves of all those who come after us. You turned away from me. and then. in my bitterness at the excess of the punishment, I turned from you, at least insofar as I sought to punish you.</p>
<p>"Poor Leah! All these years she envied you. She envied you my love which did indeed belong to you and to none other. She envied you the nights we lay together which so far outnumbered the nights I lay with her. In her humiliation she even tried to buy a night from you with the mandrakes which her son had found in the field, as if my love were something to be bartered between the two of you. But she did not know, and had she known she would not have understood, how it came about that so many of those nights together were spent in unforgiving anger so that often it would have been better had we been apart, for then we could at least have longed for each other with the same strength with which we refused each other when we were together.</p>
<p>"Now this struggle between us has ended. You died in an act of love, giving life to Benjamin, or Benoni as you wished him to be called. Your grievances against me are finally laid to rest; mine against myself and against you remain with me. Our great but frustrated love will work itself out in other ways, and I know that as my love for you was unlike that for Leah, so will my love for your sons be unlike that for my other sons.</p>
<p>"There remains one last act between us that partakes of the real, and that is your burial. I could—and it would be a small matter—take your body to the Cave of Machpelah, that it might rest there until the day when mine is placed alongside it, there to remain forever after together with those of Abraham and Isaac and their wives. I know that everyone expects me to do so, since I favored you so far above my other wives.</p>
<p>"But I will not do so. The others will not understand, but you would understand, Rachel. I will bury you here, in this place, though it is but little more than the distance of the flight of an arrow from the burial place of my fathers. I will erect a monument over your grave, a pillar. I will grieve that in your death you will be the loved one apart even as you were the loved one unattained in your life, but it would be false to simulate a reconciliation and forgiveness in death which we could not achieve in our life.</p>
<p>"Thus great love breeds great guilt and still greater rejection."</p>
<p>Thus Jacob spoke, or thought, standing over Rachel's body. When he finished he went outside and called his people together. He ordered them to dig a grave on that spot. Some of the people raised their eyebrows in surprise at the unexpected order. Others mechanically went to carry it out. Only Leah looked intently at Jacob with eyes red-rimmed from shedding the conventional tears for a deceased sister, and when she understood the import of Jacob's order, a light smile of triumph played fitfully at the corner of her mouth for an instant, and then it disappeared.</p>
