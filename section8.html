<p class=subtitle>I. The Draft</p>
<p>Ave Caesar! We who are about to die . . .</p>
<p>Nonsense. Who is about to die?</p>
<p>Twenty-four unknown soldiers and Jacob, sat in the hospital clinic waiting to be examined for the draft.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," the doctor said. "Gentlemen unknown soldiers!" And be waved a sheaf of printed forms.</p>
<p>"Which do you prefer, gentlemen, Arlington or a fascist concentration camp?"</p>
<p>"Arlington, of course. We love democracy."</p>
<p>"All right, men, take it easy now, one at a time please."</p>
<p>Jacob is called, twenty-four sit and fidget, sit and fidget for democracy.</p>
<p>We love democracy; we also love to die; it's so nice to die; all young people love to die.</p>
<p>Miss Greentree, please take a letter: "Dear Sir: Yours of the 16th inst. received and wish to state that all young people love to die. Very very truly yours."</p>
<p>Jacob was displeased, self-conscious, eager to please, anxious to have it over with, and he muttered to himself: "It is unfair."</p>
<p>"What is unfair?" he at once challenged himself.</p>
<p>"It's all unfair, the whole works; besides, the doctor and the clerk are dressed and I have only my shoes on. This is unfair. They should let me take off my shoes too." He was about to say something on this subject but the doctor began tapping his chest and muttering something to the clerk.</p>
<p>"He has a heart of gold," the twenty-four unknown soldiers recited in unison.</p>
<p>"Heart, gold, 1," the clerk wrote.</p>
<p>"His eyes are the eyes of an exile," they chanted.</p>
<p>"Eyes, exiled, 2," the clerk noted.</p>
<p>"His wandering feet traversed many a night."</p>
<p>"Feet, wandering, 2," went down on the form.</p>
<p>"He has but one life to give," they declared pointing at Jacob. "Ah, what a shame and what a pity."</p>
<p>"Life, expendable, 1," the clerk wrote.</p>
<p>"Are you married?" the doctor asked.</p>
<p>"No," Jacob said.</p>
<p>The doctor felt the spermatic cord. "Now cough," he ordered.</p>
<p>Jacob coughed uneasily while the twenty-four intoned: "For I will multiply thy seed like unto the sand on the shores of the sea."</p>
<p>"Once more!" the doctor ordered. "That's better."</p>
<p>"And thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs," the chanting subsided into a mournful murmur.</p>
<p>The clerk wrote: "Testes, abnormal, productive of excessive offspring shiftless in character, 2."</p>
<p>"Say ah. Again, louder, ahhhhhh. Not so good. Tonsils infected. Are you a fifth columnist by any chance?"</p>
<p>"No, doctor, I am not a fifth columnist. I've loved democracy all the time. Way back in 1928, when everyone was for Hoover, I was in high school then, and there was a girl in my class that we were all crazy about, so she upped and said that she was a Democrat and her folks would vote for Smith. Ever since I have been for democracy and Smith."</p>
<p>"Political affiliation, premature democrat," the clerk wrote.</p>
<p>"That's fine," the doctor approved.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's fine," Jacob seconded him.</p>
<p>"How are your teeth?"</p>
<p>"Look."</p>
<p>"Six teeth missing. An unknown soldier with four molars and two canines gone. Will that do, gentlemen? Will he do?" the doctor asked.</p>
<p>"For he is 1A in the army and Al in my heart," the twenty-four sang and stamped their feet. "He is for Smith and he'll do."</p>
<p>Ave Caesar, here he comes.</p>

<p class=subtitle>II. The Induction</p>
<p>"Now raise your right hands and say 'I do!' "</p>
<p>"I do!" came the organ response.</p>
<p>"Now you men can sit down again. The lieutenant will give a little talk. Pay close attention to what he says."</p>
<p>The lieutenant entered through a door back of the platform, quickly ap­proached the small table and began fumbling with the papers that littered it. He looked for something and could not find it. He started to talk as he con­tinued his search. His voice was indistinct. "Well now, men, you're in; I mean really in, heh heh heh. Not as bad as you think, not really. You'll see for yourself. 'Smatter of fact, this is a man's life. Of course, you got to learn a thing or two, and, what I mean, you got a job to do, a big job. On the other hand, you look to me like a good bunch of men; you won't find it hard at all. Well, as I was saying, Congratulations! Yeah, congratulations and good luck and all that. You got your job and it's all cut out for you, and I got my job too; that's the way we have it here, teamwork, like a football team for instance. Well, you know, there's a captain and there's a coach and there's running interference and tackling and all that sort of thing. But you got to use your head too, and there are some things you men don't know and you got to learn them, and it's my job here to give you one of the basic fundamentals. I mean about the enemy, what sort of man he is. In just a minute, as soon as I find what I am looking for, you'll get the idea what I mean."</p>
<p>He gave the papers a last shuffle, then began going through his pockets. His face lit up. "There it is, right in my pocket all the time. Well, anyway, men, like I said, about the enemy. I got it down here and you'll get the point right away. To make things easier we have worked out a little system, so here is how it goes. Every one of you turn around so as to face the man in the row back of you. Let each one imagine that the man he is facing is the enemy. Now I'll read you from this paper, sentence by sentence, and you recite after me. At the end of each sentence point at the man you are facing and repeat the last word three times. Now let's start:</p>
<p>"I am good and you are bad!"</p>
<p>"Bad, bad, bad!" the response thundered.</p>
<p>"I am right and you are wrong!"</p>
<p>"Wrong, wrong, wrong!"</p>
<p>"I am brave and you are yellow!"</p>
<p>"Yellow, yellow, yellow!" the men poked each other in the chest.</p>
<p>"Now let us put a little more life into it!" the lieutenant ordered. "I will win and you will lose!"</p>
<p>"Lose, lose, lose!"</p>
<p>"I am big and you are small!"</p>
<p>"Small, small, small!"</p>
<p>"I will stand and you will fall!"</p>
<p>"Fall, fall, fall!"</p>
<p>"My girl is pure, your dame is a whore!"</p>
<p>"Whore, whore, whore!"</p>
<p>"I tell the truth, you only lie!"</p>
<p>"Lie, lie, lie!"</p>
<p>"I will live and you will die!"</p>
<p>"Die! die! die!"</p>
<p>"That's all; like I told you, it's easy; nothing to it for a man with any gumption. But you get the general idea. Now we are practically through here. The corporal there will take you all to the supply room where you'll be issued uniforms and rifles, and then you'll get your shots and all the rest of that. Corporal, take over!"</p>
<p>They filed out into the drizzling twilight. The entire area was deep in mud and they stepped gingerly on a rickety catwalk that meandered alongside the buildings. The head of the file halted at the door of the huge supply building, and one by one they entered and made their way along the counters heaped with uniforms. Quickly the various items were tossed to the men as they passed and checked off on the printed forms each carried with him. The rear end of the line was still trailing far outdoors when the head of the file was already leaving through the other exit.</p>
<p>Lugging his load of clothing, Jacob approached the last of the counters. The supply sergeant tossed a cartridge belt and some other webbed items in his direction without looking at him, then took the printed form to make the required entries. He casually glanced over it, made a few marks, and was about to return it to Jacob for his signature when his eye caught on some fine print on the bottom of the sheet that startled him. "W-o-w-w-w-!" he ex­claimed softly and fixed Jacob with a stare of amazement, admiration and also much compassion.</p>
<p>"Hey, fellas, look what I got here!" he called to the others behind the counters.</p>
<p>A few of the clerks stepped up; others called from a distance: "What you got there, Sarge?"</p>
<p>"One of them!" the sergeant called back while the clerks crowded about him trying to see the printed form. Having satisfied themselves that the form did say what they expected, they too looked at Jacob with surprise and pity. Some whistled meaningfully.</p>
<p>Jacob did not know what all the excitement was about and felt too em­barrassed to ask, especially since he had no inkling of what could possibly have gone wrong.</p>
<p>"X-17; boy, you sure are it!" the sergeant explained, leaving him as un­comprehending as before.</p>
<p>"What's it, Sarge?" Jacob ventured timidly, but the sergeant did not bother to answer. Instead he called another clerk to take charge of his counter and beckoned Jacob to follow him.</p>
<p>They made their way through the labyrinth of loaded counters and passed through a number of adjoining rooms until they came to a locked door. The sergeant opened it and they entered a small dark room. He turned on the light. Jacob looked about himself in perplexity. It seemed to be a museum room. A number of suits of medieval armor stood rigidly along two walls. Sheaves of spears and battle axes leaned in disorder against the other walls. In one corner lay a heap of metal objects that looked like maces.</p>
<p>"That one should be just about right," the sergeant said pointing to one of the suits of armor after measuring Jacob with his eyes. "That should just about fit you." He went up to it and began dismantling it. "Come on, let's not waste time; try this one," he ordered Jacob.</p>
<p>"But this is medieval armor!" Jacob cried. "What goes on here? Are we going to play King Arthur?"</p>
<p>"Look, fella," the sergeant said gruffly, "we don't play games here. Orders call for this, and this you'll get. Now get into it."</p>
<p>Jacob struggled with the cumbersome metal pieces. With the sergeant's aid he finally got them all on and laced. He stood rigidly and could barely move. The sergeant looked him over appraisingly and decided: "It fits."</p>
<p>"But how will I get around in it?" Jacob protested. "I can barely move at all."</p>
<p>"That's tough," the sergeant ruled impersonally, "but orders are orders." Jacob felt trapped and ventured one more question: "How come none of the other fellows get this junk?"</p>
<p>"It's not junk, and only those get it whose orders call for it. But don't worry; you won't have to wear it all the time. This is a special uniform for special assignments only."</p>
<p>"But I haven't received any special assignments!"</p>
<p>"No? Maybe not. When you get them you'll have to wear this when on special duty. Now take off the suit and let's get going. I got a lot of work to do, and you got plenty ahead of you too. Here, you can have this key to the room."</p>
<p>Jacob followed him back through the maze of rooms and counters. He picked up the cloth uniform he had been issued and stepped outside. It was dark. The group he was with was far down the street where they waited to be inoculated.</p>
<p>It was ten o'clock before Jacob completed his induction formalities and was assigned a cot in a barrack. He dumped his new possessions on his bed and sat down exhausted. His mind was in a whirl. He very much wanted to think about some of the strange things that happened to him that day, but he could not. All about him was the noise of men talking, laughing and arranging their things. There was a hum in his head and his brain seemed to press hard against his forehead and the forward part of his skull. He resigned himself to the hum.</p>

<p class=subtitle>III. The Obstacle Course</p>
<p>It was long past midnight when Jacob finally dropped into restless sleep crowded with anxious dreams. At first the dreams were all mixed but grad­ually they sorted themselves into a semblance of order. In his dream Jacob found himself in a crowded barrack, but the barrack was in the hands of the enemy and everyone in it was a prisoner of war. Periodically enemy soldiers entered and picked at random ten of the men and led them outside to be shot. The sound of the volleys was heard distinctly inside, yet no one seemed concerned about them. Jacob was engaged in a heated argument with someone about furloughs. "I tell you that when you go on furlough you carry your weapons with you," he insisted. His opponent, whose indistinct face irritated him unreasonably, denied this. But even as he was pursuing his argument Jacob tried to draw his antagonist into a remote corner of the barrack to avoid being picked for execution with the next group. "Come, I'll show you where the rifles are stacked in the corner," he insisted, as if the sight of the rack would somehow settle the argument in his favor. His an­tagonist was doubtful and followed him unwillingly. They reached the rack in the corner, but just then the enemy soldiers entered and forced a path through the crowded barrack to the corner. There they picked up the next group of prisoners for execution, including Jacob and his opponent. As they were being led out the man insistently repeated, "See? I told you! Wasn't that what I said? You don't take your weapons with you on furlough." "Well, yes, I guess you are right," Jacob conceded and at once began worry­ing whether he would be first to be shot. The group was led to the rear of the kitchen behind the mess hall. They were not lined up, and huddled in a bunch beside the wall. Jacob heard the enemy officer instruct his men: "Look into their eyes," he said, "use a flashlight. If any of them have grey eyes, count them out." This strange order did not surprise Jacob in the least, though he wondered what being "counted out" meant. Instead he suddenly felt almost glad. "Now I will find out what is the true color of my eyes," he thought. One after another the men were called and an enemy soldier flashed a light into their eyes. "No," was the brief report after each examination and the victim was led toward the lined up garbage cans and shot by a volley from three rifles. Jacob was sixth to be called. His curiosity and light-head­edness vanished. "Now they will shoot me," he thought as he dragged his heavy feet toward the enemy soldier with the flashlight. Frantically he hoped for some unexpected reprieve but knew that he was doomed. When the light flashed into his eyes he blinked. Rills of chilly sweat ran down his body. "I am so sleepy I can't open my eyes," he begged. "Take the next one while I wash my eyes with some cold water." "Now," the enemy soldier said gruf­fly, "it's your turn."</p>
<p>Jacob awoke with a start. The light from a small fountain-pen flashlight played on his face. The light was held by a general in full dress uniform. It was the camp commander. "It's your turn," he said to Jacob, "follow me." Jacob leaped out of bed and dressed quickly. The general waited for him and meanwhile nervously poked the slim beam of light on the walls and ceiling. "Bang!" he said each time he halted the light on one spot. "Should I take my rifle?" Jacob asked. "Say 'Sir' when you address me," the general replied severely. "Now follow me."</p>
<p>Quietly they went outside and Jacob meekly followed the general as he made his way confidently in the dark over invisible paths. The lights of the camp were soon lost behind them and by the rustling on either side Jacob concluded that they were walking amid many trees. After almost an hour they emerged from the forest. Here too the darkness was so intense that nothing could be discerned. "It should be somewhere around here," the general said. "What are we looking for, sir?" Jacob asked. "The obstacle course," the general whispered and got down on his hands and knees and began groping around. Jacob followed his example. "Let us use your flash­light to find it," Jacob suggested. "It's against regulations," the general said. "Here it is," the general finally announced. "I don't see anything," Jacob complained, "it's too dark." "Lie down flat on the ground and feel with your hands extended and you will find it."</p>
<p>Jacob did as he was ordered and his fingers touched the edge of a crevice in the ground. "Is this the obstacle course, sir?" he asked. "This is only part of it," the general whispered, "this is only a ditch. You are supposed to jump over it." "Now? In the dark?" Jacob wondered. "No, not now; now I am only giving you the nomenclature." "Is it deep?" "Yes, it is very deep." "And how wide is it?" Jacob also spoke in a whisper. "It is of var­iable width," the general answered. "Suppose I fall in?" "You won't fall in." "I have a feeling that I most certainly shall fall in." "That often hap- pens," the general said. "In that case you wait until you feel you can make the jump." "What if the waiting lasts a long time?" "You wait as long as is necessary and then you make your leap." "Suppose I wait so long that I die waiting?" "What of it?" "Will they release my body for civilian bur­ial?" "Of course not! What an idea!" "What will they do with me if I die?" "Your body will be tossed over the ditch and then it will be buried with due military honors." "Will they let my family come to visit my grave?" "On Decoration Day only." "I see," Jacob said.</p>
<p>"Now move to this side and we will go to the next obstacle," the general said. "Is the ditch so short that we can crawl around it?" "It is a ditch; its length doesn't matter. Here is the next obstacle, feel it." "It feels like a smooth wall." "It is a smooth wall." "Does it have any doors or windows in it?" "No, you are supposed to scale it." "It appears to be very high; I can't reach the top." "It is quite high." "Then how will I scale it since it is so smooth and there is nothing to hold on to?" "There are no rules governing this. Everyone works out his own procedures. This is one advantage of the obstacle course—many regulations are suspended here. This gives you a chance to show your ingenuity. Do you have any ideas how you will over­come the obstacle of the wall?" "I can't think of any at the moment," Jacob said, "but I might simply stand before it, and maybe weep and implore it to let me pass." "You mean you would make a wailing wall of it?" the general asked. "You might call it that if you wish, sir." "It is a highly unorthodox method," the general whispered deliberately, "but, as I said, many rules are suspended here, and certain liberties are allowed on this course that are not tolerated elsewhere. In fact, the suspension of many rules is in itself a rule that may not be broken, and should you decide to use this method, I do not have the authority to hinder you. But this you will have to decide later. You may change your mind; at least I hope you will."</p>
<p>"Are there many more obstacles?" Jacob wanted to know. "The number does not matter," the general explained. "An obstacle course is a qualitative not a quantitative fact; this you must understand, otherwise you miss the entire point. Some obstacles are not obstacles at all—at least they do not offer the same measure of hindrance to everyone. The question is a twofold one: to what extent they are obstacles to you, and the manner in which you approach the solution of the problem. For instance, if you were to wait at the ditch till you are certain that you won't fall in when you jump, you may wait all your life, as you yourself said, and in that case it becomes an in­superable obstacle to you. I am trying to explain this roughly, for the matter is really much more complicated. Let us crawl over to the next one and you will understand better what I mean. Now here is a barbed wire concertina through which you will have to crawl. You may think that all you will have to do is avoid tearing your hands and knees on the wire. It is impossible, for instance, to fall out of it. It does not require either jumping or scaling. And sometimes it is really as simple as all that. But there are days when we let a stream of water flow through the barbed wire concertina." "How is that possible when the concertina consists only of loops of wire? What will hold the water inside it?" Jacob wanted to know. "It is a good question and I expected you to ask it," the general said, "but I will not answer it now; as a matter of fact I will never answer it and you will never know how it is done. It is enough for you to know that it is done and that you will have to negotiate the concertina when there is at least a foot of water in it. At times we release small fish into the concertina. They are no hindrance in themselves, but as they swim around they tickle you and you have to con­trol yourself and not wiggle unnecessarily, otherwise you will tear your skin on the barbed wire." "Then I will rip my skin," Jacob said matter-of-factly. "I am not afraid of pain." "If you are not afraid of pain you have the makings of a good soldier and I will personally tell your corporal about it tomorrow and ask him to keep an eye on you with a view to your future promotion. But in regard to the obstacle course your attitude to pain is irrel­evant. You must preserve the skin of your hands not because of the pain but on account of the next obstacle which you will have to face. That consists of a rope suspended from a big tree. When you emerge from the concertina you have to seize this rope and swing on it as far as you can. Let the momentum carry you, and drop off when you reach the farthest point of the arc. Should you by any chance injure your hands in the con­certina, you will either be unable to hold on to the rope and will have to start again, or you will be so paralyzed by pain that you will not be able to let go and you might continue swinging back and forth indefinitely." "What kind of tree is the rope suspended from?" Jacob wanted to know. "Oh, the tree, it is quite a remarkable tree." the general said still in a whisper, but there was enthusiasm in his voice. "It is the tree under which Washington—or rather his representative—accepted Cornwallis's sword." "But that was at Yorktown," Jacob demurred. "Of course," the general agreed. "We had it transplanted here. We brought it specially for the obstacle course. Naturally, you can't see it now because it is so dark, but you can take my word for it that it is a huge tree. Bringing it here was a big job. But now we must return to our subject. The obstacle after the swinging rope was nicknamed by somebody Evolution Obstacle. I do not want you to call it that because we disapprove of levity here, though now, in the dark, I must admit that the nickname is not entirely inept, even though it is a little too obvious. It consists first of a pool across which you have to swim, then a stretch covered with sharp gravel over which it is necessary to crawl, then comes a horizontal ladder. The first half of the ladder has to be negotiated hand-over-hand, the second half has to be walked over upright. A trite name, you will agree. And after that we come to the ditch." "Another ditch?" Jacob asked. "No," the general said, "the same ditch." "Then this is a circular obstacle course. I did not notice this in the dark," Jacob said. "No," the general was displeased. "This is not a circular obstacle course even though it is the same ditch. I see that despite my instruction you still cling to your civilian delusions. I will therefore again try to give you some conceptions that may prove useful to you. Please observe, for instance, that in the present case the course might be straight and yet the ditch may be curved, in fact it may encircle the entire obstacle course. I said 'it may' encircle the course, because actually it doesn't do anything of the sort. For after this ditch you will again find the wall and the concertina and the other obstacles. I merely offered the suggestion to you as one of innumerable possibilities—in this case one that does not apply. In time you will get to understand this much better." "Then I will never finish running the course," Jacob objected. "When you address a superior officer you must say 'Sir,' and you simply must not jump to conclusions," the general observed. "Now you are doing just that—jumping to a conclusion that is not necessarily so. I am in a position to throw some light on this subject now. As a matter of fact, I brought you here precisely for this purpose. Had you not been so befuddled by the events of recent days, it would have occurred to you that it was strange that an officer of general's rank should bring you here at night to indoctrinate you in the principles of the obstacle course. It could very well have been done during the day, and perhaps even by someone of lower rank. But I have with me orders received from the War Department which I have to impart to you. These orders are, naturally, top secret, and there­fore the dark of night was required for their revelation to you. These orders cannot be countermanded. They are final. Yet their implementation offers many possibilities which we cannot foresee at this time. Briefly, these orders concern your permanent and chief role in this great historic conflict in which we are at present engaged and which, God willing, we shall carry to a triumphant conclusion. Jacob! Soon the men in your unit will be shipped to the front to meet such fate as awaits them and to acquit them. selves as best they can—all the men but one, and you are that exception. The War Department has assigned to you a unique role of manifold impli­cations, and this role you are to fulfill for the duration, however long or short that may be. You will be freed from all other duties—at least from all those that might interfere with your assignment. You will not go overseas; you will never see the enemy. It will be your duty and your privilege to run this obstacle course once a day, every day, as long as the war lasts. While doing so you will wear your armor, of course. This is your assign­ment. Are you content with it?"</p>
<p>"Will it help the larger effort of all?" Jacob asked.</p>
<p>"You must say `Sir' when you address me," the general snapped.</p>

<p class=subtitle>IV. The Bayonet Course</p>
<p>The platoon lay sprawled on the gravel in front of the barrack watching the corporal setting up a crude diagram of a human body on a shaky easel. When he finished balancing it he winked to the men: "This is going to be fun."</p>
<p>"That's a hell of a pin-up you got there, Corp," someone remarked, but the corporal only repeated his hint: "This is going to be fun."</p>
<p>"Now let me have your attention, men," he assumed a serious mien. "Today you will learn about the use of the bayonet. A bayonet is the most important weapon a man has; don't let anyone tell you different. A rifle is fine, and artillery and tanks and planes and all the rest of that are all very good. But there is no weapon like a bayonet in a pinch. It's part of you and you are part of it. That's why I want you to pay careful attention. Now if you will look closely at this chart you will note . . ."</p>
<p>But just then a ribald breeze pressed against the precariously balanced chart. It rocked and gently slid to the ground.</p>
<p>"To hell with the chart," the corporal said in disgust, "we'll do it a better way. You there, Jake," he beckoned to Jacob, "come over here and face the platoon." Jacob obeyed.</p>
<p>"Now you will observe carefully," the corporal went on pointing at Jacob, "that there are three vulnerable areas in a man: the head, the belly and the groin. Get him in any one of the three and he is your meat. Don't bother about any other part; it's not worth the trouble. We will start at the top. The thing to do there is jab him in the throat. That's easy. All you have to do is get the bayonet point in an inch or two and he is through. If you can't do that, then try to hit him on the chin with the butt of your rifle. You can hit him either horizontally or vertically, then you smash him in the face a couple of times. Let me show you how."</p>
<p>The corporal took his bayonetted rifle and went through the motions a few inches from Jacob's face.</p>
<p>"Now, next is the stomach area. That's nice and soft. Don't jab an enemy in the ribs. You'll only get yourself in trouble. Your bayonet will get stuck or break. But the stomach—that's a different story. Easy to get into. And you do it this way, with a long thrust that goes deep into him. Then you withdraw and give him another jab, just to make sure.</p>
<p>"But if you have closed in with the enemy and you have no chance to make a thrust, then you use the butt again, on his groin this time. One quick one will do the trick."</p>
<p>Again he illustrated the movements on Jacob and ordered him back to the group. He looked about, saw that no one else was around and gave the men permission to smoke. He lit one himself and proceeded in relaxed and confidential tone.</p>
<p>"Well, men, you can forget about the chart and all this sort of crap. You guys don't need a chart. You know what the score is. It's the principle that counts in bayonet work, and as I look at you I have an idea that you all know what that is. Of course, you will have to put up with a lot of baloney about parrying just so, and doing a stroke or a jab just the right way, the way the manuals say it's got to be done. That's all a lot of form, as long as we are in camp here. When we get out of here and hit the real thing you'll know yourself what to do. And the principle of the bayonet is very simple: it's thrust, withdraw, thrust, and smash, smash, smash. Now, that's the principle of life, if you get what I mean. If you're gonna start figuring how to do it, and are you doing it the right way, and are you doing it in the right order, then you are a cooked goose. You don't figure about things like that. You just do! Your instincts will tell you what's right. And you don't play fair with a bayonet. That's out. When you close in with the enemy you deliver your thrust or you are . . ."</p>
<p>"Royally, eh Corp?" someone called from the bunch.</p>
<p>"There is a man who got the idea," the corporal approved.</p>
<p>A flutter of snickering rippled through the group.</p>
<p>"You don't play fair and you don't lone-wolf it. You attack in pairs, to make absolutely sure you don't get left."</p>
<p>"Something like a line-up?" the same voice interjected from the group.</p>
<p>"Right again," the corporal assented. "I see we got one man here who will live to come home again. And that's what I meant when I said at the beginning that this is going to be fun. Lots of guys are scared of cold steel. But this isn't a bayonet; this is life," he held up his bayonet rever­ently. "and you use it just as you do in life."</p>
<p>"Corp, you mean the bayonet course the other side of camp is something like a whore house?" a thin voice piped.</p>
<p>The corporal blew a cloud of smoke, stared intently at the group and asked sententiously: "Why a whore house? 'Why not a bridal chamber?"</p>
<p>"What? Twenty bridal chambers right next to each other?" came from several in the group.</p>
<p>Everybody laughed. "We'll fix that," the corporal reassured them. "We'll get the chaplain to say a prayer over the bayonet course. Will that make you feel better?"</p>
<p>"Just the same. I'd rather go to town than to the bayonet course next time I get a pass."</p>
<p>"We'll all go to town pretty soon, but not the town you have in mind. And when we get there I know you will act like the real men you are."</p>
<p>A uniformed man approached the group. The corporal ground his cigarette into the gravel and ordered the others to do the same. It was a messenger from camp headquarters and he handed the corporal a mimeo. graphed note. It read: "To All Instructors: Effective this date, all troops doing bayonet drill or running the bayonet course will report to the base prophylactic station as soon as they have completed their assignment. No exceptions will be allowed. The men will be marched to the station in formation and at attention. Full military discipline will be maintained."</p>
<p>The corporal folded the note and put it in his pocket.</p>
<p>"Yeah, remember this," he summarized. "The principle is: Thrust, with­draw, thrust, and smash, smash, smash. Once you know this you know all that is worth knowing."</p>

<p class=subtitle>V. The Law</p>
<p>"And when you get the bayonet into his belly it'll be pretty hard to pull it out. But you got to get it out quick. There'll be lots of others to go after. So, step on the man and yank; pull with all your strength. What makes it so hard? Pressure, that's what does it. You wouldn't think so, you wouldn't think soft flesh can press so hard against a steel bayonet. But just you wait and see."</p>
<p class=ital>There'll be blue birds over / The white cliffs of Dover / Tomorrow just you wait and see.</p>
<p>"Pressure is what does it. It's a mechanical law—vacuum inside and atmospheric pressure outside. It's all a matter of mechanical laws."</p>
<p>The body is made out of cells, all of them unconscious, but every one of them performs a certain function. In people and other complicated animals the cells bunch together into organs. The cells are still unconscious but the organ as a whole performs a specialized function, like, let's say, a liver or a kidney or something like that. I read all about it. So there we are, people, complicated organisms, every part of us doing something special, just like in society, bakers and street-car conductors and automobile manu­facturers and capitalists and workers and all that. The body functions all right because it is specialized and organized, while society, I mean our capitalist society, has no plan to it, all chaos and free enterprise and com­petition, everybody doing just as he likes and everybody competing with everybody else and the whole thing is a mess. What do you suppose would happen if a brain cell started to act like a kidney cell and excreted urine? Heh, heh, heh. There you got it, in a nutshell; that's our social system for you. No planning, see? There's no plan to capitalist society. In the body it's different, there's plan. The liver cell does one thing and the brain cell something else and so on down the line, and if any cell tries to act up on its own, why then the body gets sick and runs a temperature and gets rid of that cell, or if there are lots of them why then the body might die. And that's just what's happening to capitalist society. Unless there's going to be plan­ning, socialist planning, society will rot away and die.</p>
<p>But, wait, Jacob had rebelled with all the strength of his sixteen years, you say, and I agree with you, that the cells are unconscious and the organs, though specialized, are also unconscious. They are made to perform one certain function and they do it without knowing why, without caring why, just a sort of perpetual motion machine producing urine or bile or saliva or something. Well, that sounds efficient all right, I don't deny that, but it's mechanical, it's dead, it's just so many wheels turning without knowing where or why or who started them turning.</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>No, you wait; I haven't finished yet. So you say let's have planning and organization and socialism so that every cell should belong to one big organ and every organ do its share to keep society operating. But the indi­vidual cell and the organ to which it belongs will remain unconscious. So what sense is there to it? All you are after with your planned society is a smooth working machine, no more.</p>
<p>Well, what's wrong with that? Would you rather have chaos like now? And unemployment, and competition, and capitalist wars?</p>
<p>You don't get me, Jacob pleaded for his life. Of course I am against unemployment and competition and wars and all that, but don't you see? One cell, like an amoeba, it's free. It can go this way and that way, any way it pleases. I know that an amoeba is unconscious. But what I mean is freedom, to be complicated organisms like you and me yet be free to do as we like, not just specialized cells in a planned society, always doing the same thing, doing it well, very well, but always the same, being a piece of liver instead of a man—of course, what I mean is a sort of social liver or spleen or something. And then one part of society will be the brain and will rule everybody else, but they won't know why they do it, because they have no choice in the matter, and another part will produce food and be like the stomach of humanity, and nothing else, and so on down the line.</p>
<p>Well, would you rather have the present inefficiency?</p>
<p>No, I didn't say that. But who wants to be just a cell in a social organism?</p>
<p>Well, what do you want to be?</p>
<p>I want to be a free human being, not just a cog in the planned society.</p>
<p>You are sentimental and, what's more, you don't know what you are talk­ing about. I tell you it's been proved scientifically by everybody, Darwin and Marx and Lenin, and even the capitalists know it but they are just fighting for their privileges. They are not conscious of what they are doing, but they fight just the same. Like the appendix for instance. It's no use any more. It has outlived its usefulness. But it fights for its existence just the same. It's a law of nature to fight. for existence. That's why the appendix gets infected and inflamed now and then and it is necessary to cut it out, otherwise the patient will die. It's the same with the present social system. It has outlived its usefulness but it fights to keep on living, that's why it causes wars and unemployment and crises and it has to be cut out and thrown away. It's a law of nature, a mechanical law.</p>
<p>Then they are just as right as we are.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>If it's all a matter of mechanical laws and there is no choice and no freedom, then there is no right and no wrong. The appendix is just as right, morally speaking, as the heart or brain. All of them are just blindly re­sponding to laws.</p>
<p>Morally, Jacob's companion jeered. Boy, you sure got some fumy reactionary ideas. What's morality got to do with it? I am telling you about the laws that govern society, the way the greatest minds have analyzed them, and you come back with talk about morality. I suppose you will say next that it is morally wrong for a hungry worker to steal a piece of bread, he sneered.</p>
<p>Jacob evaded the last sally. He said: Then what's the use?</p>
<p>What's the use of what?</p>
<p>What's the use of everything? 'What's the use of socialism? What differ­ence does it make whether the workers rule the world or some other class? What difference does it make whether we have a big strong appendix and a weak brain or the other way around, as long as the organism continues to function? Elephants have tusks, monkeys have tails, we have better de­veloped brains. Morally there is no difference between them, if, as you say, it's all merely a matter of mechanical laws. So why bother with organizing for socialism and the planned society?</p>
<p>You don't get my point at all. I can see that. What do you mean, Why bother? Wouldn't you. rather have equality and no exploitation and no waste?</p>
<p>Sure I would. But I want this because I think it is better, it's more human, more fair, more just, not just for the sake of efficiency of production, as you said before.</p>
<p>All right, Jacob's companion conceded patronizingly. Have it your way. It doesn't matter how you justify your point of view as long as you reach the right conclusion. In time you'll get over a lot of your sentimental notions. What you need is more study of the fundamentals of social science.</p>
<p>They stood before the huge limestone City Hall. Jacob stared at it and felt grey inside. He visualized a red flag over the cupola on the roof. Socialism had come. Down with . . .! But the flag hung limp, heavy with rain. Posters on the walls and in the windows proclaimed the triumph of the revolution. The sky was sullen and people hurried. Why didn't the flag wave? Why didn't bells peal in his blood as they had on previous occasions when he thought of the day of the liberation of man? He made an effort to recapture some of the jubilation he used to feel at youth group meetings, a taste of the surge of gladness which the vision of the future used to arouse, and he could not. He struggled to formulate his companion's convictions, and his own faith of such a short time ago, but all that came to his mind were words—efficiency, planned society, scientific organization; and he was frightened by their strange detachment from any meaning in his mind.</p>
<p>"Now there, you, Jake," the corporal jerked him out of his reverie, "it's your turn."</p>
<p>Startled, he leaped back into reality and approached the upright beam. A board had been nailed to it. The trick was to drive the bayonet between the board and the beam with all one's strength and to pull it out again with a sudden jerk.</p>
<p>"On Guard!" the corporal cried and Jacob mechanically assumed the proper stance.</p>
<p>"Now imagine there is a Jap or a German before you, or think of some­one you particularly hate, then let him have it with all you got."</p>
<p>Jacob tried to visualize an enemy but the foe remained an indistinct blur. The song about the cliffs of Dover swirled in his head and he felt terribly homesick. The faint image of the enemy melted away.</p>
<p>"Long Thrust!" the corporal's command slapped him on the face. Blindly he jabbed in the direction of the beam. The point of the bayonet struck weakly at the edge of the board and broke off a sliver.</p>
<p>He felt the eyes of the others and hated himself. Now, if this were a real enemy I would do it properly, he thought. Anyway, I would shoot him, but I don't think I could bayonet him. Why not? What difference would it make how you kill him? He is the enemy. Yes, but . . . But what? . . . Weak nerves . . . No, it's not that . . .</p>
<p class=ital>There'll be love and laughter / And peace ever after / Tomorrow just you wait and see.</p>
<p>He mechanically resumed his On Guard stance. He felt on the verge of tears. "I don't want to stick the bayonet into the enemy." "Coward. What difference does it make? Morally it's all the same, like amoebas and liver cells and brain cells and kidney cells. It's all the same. Socialism, the enemy, efficiency, science, like cells."</p>
<p>Through the window the black-green forest was dense against the bright blue sky. A mild breeze was bruising itself against the sharp edges of the barrack.</p>
<p>Suddenly Jacob was far away. It was a hot summer afternoon. He was walking along an abandoned railway track that wound among tall weeds. He felt somnolent and warm and languid. There was a sustained musical note in the air.</p>
<p>"That's all now," the corporal announced. "Fall out in ten minutes in class A uniform. And you, Jake, better shape up. Snap out of it. That's a bayonet you got, not a lead pencil."</p>

<p class=subtitle>VI. The Difference</p>
<p>But there must be a difference, there must, Jacob's mind tugged at him relentlessly.</p>
<p>His company was on one of its seemingly interminable hikes. The men strung out in staggered formation along both sides of the road. It was near­ing noon and they had already covered many miles. It was a hot day, but for some distance the road passed through dense woods and they were in the shade. The forest twilight was mournful and the cool dampness of decaying leaves soothed with a suggestion of peace.</p>
<p>"That's a bayonet you got, not a lead pencil," the corporal had told him the day before. Now the scabbard of the bayonet slapped rhythmically against his left thigh at each step. They had just finished their fourth ten-minute stop and Jacob did not feel tired. If his mind weren't impaled on these meaningless debates with himself, he thought, it would be pleasant to walk like this without a destination and only distance to cover.</p>
<p>The enemy—that much is clear. The killing part is clear too. Thee why . . . Why what? Why not jab and punch and rend? Of course, it is necessary. Could I be the enemy? No. Could the man next to me? Yes, why not? Assuming that I too could be the enemy, or like him, then what? Then nothing, then it's all a matter of roosters fighting. And if I jab the bayonet into him with all my might, don't I become like him? What am I supposed to do then? Kill myself because I have become like him? Or is there a difference still?</p>
<p>Heroism. Workers of the world unite! The flag over City Hall. Is that the difference, the mumbo-jumbo Amen before the charge, even if it is recited mechanically without knowing or caring what it means? When Con­gress opens they invite a man of God to recite a prayer. Bourgeois hypocrisy. Workers of the world unite. Socialist hypocrisy. But an army is like a football team. Yea, team! No prayers are said before a football game. No hypocrisy there. But what's the point? Just winning? Simply cells? Army Hqs Release #99: Today the liver counter-attacked along the entire front. The enemy suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Well, what do you want? The sergeant should recite a prayer before leading you to the bayonet course?</p>
<p>Maybe that's what I really want.</p>
<p>Memory of an incident from his childhood days rose to Jacob's mind. His mother had bought a chicken for the Sabbath. She had been too busy herself, so she sent him to the schochet to have it killed. He remembered it vividly. It was a young black rooster with a silvery ruff around its neck. He didn't mind the trip to the schochet but in the street some children began ribbing him. "What you got there? A Thanksgiving turkey? This ain't Thanksgiving." Some of them wanted to handle the rooster. Others sug­gested untying the bird and having a race to see who could catch it. The rooster became excited, started cackling loudly and ended with a full-throated crow. Jacob extricated himself from his friends and brought the bird to the schochet. He had seen the man kill poultry before and it had never made a strong impression upon him. This time it was different and the minutest details now came back to his mind. He was the only customer and he had to ring the doorbell. As the schochet was getting ready, Jacob went around the house to the back yard where the slaughtering was done in a shed. The floor was covered with sand and an odor of blood hung in the air. The schochet finally came, a medium sized man with a flowing beard and a skull cap on his head. He slowly removed the slaughtering knife from its case, then he spread some ashes near the wall and took the rooster from Jacob's hands. He seized both wings in one hand and turned the bird upside down so that the belly faced upward and the legs were drawn in as in a cramp. He pulled the head back and seized the comb between the thumb and forefinger of the hand that held the wings. The rooster was quiet and did not kick. With the other hand the schochet plucked a few small feathers from the throat, then he took the knife, recited a prayer and smoothly passed the razor-sharp edge over the plucked area. The rooster kicked convulsively. The schochet held the bird head down for a moment while the blood drained, then he threw it on the ground. The rooster lay quietly for a second then began flapping his wings violently. He leaped into the air despite his bound feet, fell back again, stretched his neck and legs in agony. This went on for a little while, then the eyelids slowly closed, the neck stretched convulsively for the last time in final denial, and the body Jay lifeless and crumpled on the ground.</p>
<p>Is that what you want? Jacob now asked himself. A prayer? A bene­diction? Praise the Lord and pass the knife? Would that make it better than if the rooster had had his head chopped off without a benediction?</p>
<p>The rooster lay dead, the silvery ruff crumpled and stained with blood. It was a young bird, only a few months old. That spring a hen on some farm must have begun to feel strangely romantic, Jacob mused. Whenever the big rooster, a large black-and-silver bird, masculine with feathers on his feet, came near, she felt an irrepressible urge to squat and spread her wings lightly to balance herself under his weight. He invariably accepted the invitation, proudly, disdainfully, never even acknowledging the favor by calling her later when he found some grains near the manure pile. She was a maverick hen and found herself a secluded spot behind the barn where she laid her eggs. No one knew her secret. When she had nearly a dozen eggs she began to brood and then vanished for nearly three weeks after which she reappeared in the yard leading her flock, small and spherical and fluffy and black. But she would not take them into the hen house at night. She always took them to her nest. By now the farmer knew where the nest was and did not interfere with her. Then came a fateful night, and with it a weasel. The farmer heard the commotion behind the barn. In the morn­ing the hen came leading but one chick. For some days she frantically dashed around seeking something, then she seemed to forget. The surviving chick already sprouted black feathers and there was a hint of silver about his neck. He thrived and grew and was everything a proper young rooster should be. Late in the summer he was bartered to a peddler, together with some other items, for some yard goods, and after changing hands once or twice more he ended in the possession of Jacob's mother. And what of the hen? Jacob thought. Was she supposed to cheer that her one remaining chick was done in properly, with a benediction before having his throat slit, not like the others that were rent apart by a weasel? And what of the schochet? Did he murder the bird any less because he had uttered a prayer over its submissive neck?</p>
<p>What an analogy, Jacob jeered at himself, what a hell of an analogy. And yet there is something to it. Of course there is the matter of the right cause, and causes have slogans and slogans are not so different from prayers. Shema Yisroel! Workers of the world! Blessed art Thou!</p>
<p>Then why was it said when the schochet died some years later that it was because he couldn't bear his trade? It pained him, they said, every time he had to kill a chicken. And whenever he had to slaughter a large animal, he would return home sick at heart. He had always thought of changing his trade, but somehow never got around to it, and in the end his heart gave under the strain. Not even his countless benedictions helped, apparently.</p>
<p>And yet, I suppose it makes a difference, Jacob concluded wearily and with not much conviction.</p>

<p class=subtitle>VII. The Sermon</p>
<p>"You guys don't seem to understand; you don't take it seriously; you think it's a game. This is war!" It was the Major addressing the battalion lined up on the parade ground.</p>
<p>"This is for keeps. I had a son. He was in Corregidor. Do you know what happened there?"</p>
<p>The battalion stood at attention. The Major concluded his speech, then said something in a low voice to his junior officers. There was saluting back and forth and he left. The companies were marched back to their areas.</p>
<p>Dinner call was sounded almost as soon as the men took off their equip­ment. The barrack at once became deserted, except for Jacob. During the retreat parade and the speech by the Major that followed the lowering of the colors, his mind had been in a strange and compulsive turmoil. Now, when all the others rushed to the mess hall, he stayed behind. He took out some sheets of paper, placed his trunk on his cot for a table, and began writing rapidly, crossing out words, rewriting them, and becoming unbearably excited.</p>
<p>"Sermon on the Parade Ground," he quickly jotted down the title; then, "My Friends," but he at once crossed out these words with a gesture of revulsion. Like a fireside chat, he thought. Yes siree, Yes siree, Franklin Dee, Franklin Dee. Then he tried "Dear Brothers" and was alike displeased with its pompousness.</p>
<p>He skipped half a page and plunged into the body of his sermon:</p>
<p>"Much we do not know and much is not given us to understand. But from the little that we do know we can, with an effort, come to understand much that is hidden. And I will now reveal to you something that has remained unknown to this day. You all know of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, how he was taken to Golgotha and was there nailed to the cross between two thieves. You also know how in his anguish he called out to God and com­plained that he had been forsaken.</p>
<p>"Now, dear friends," and Jacob at once crossed out the words "dear friends," irked by their false solemnity and simply wrote "fellows." "Now, fellows, is it not strange that Jesus, who came to save the world from sin and evil and wickedness, should show such weakness at the moment of his trial? Is it possible that the redeemer of the world was a coward, a simple ordinary coward who gets frightened when he is under fire or in pain and cries for his mother or runs away—misbehaves in front of the enemy, as the book of army regulations would say—or is overcome with self-pity and feels that he has been abandoned, that he got a tough break, that he should have had a furlough instead of being sent up front? Surely such a thing is unlikely. You and I, fellows, you and I might behave like that. But not the redeemer! Had he not proclaimed himself as such? Had he not an­nounced that he would be sacrificed to save humanity? Then how explain this weakness in him when the final moment came?</p>
<p>"But, fellows. there is more to this story than appears on the surface. And I want to tell you about it.</p>
<p>"This is the way it happened and this is how it came to pass. For many years before Jesus was born, not just years but entire centuries, a great argument went on between Jesus and God. For, one day, soon after Adam sinned, God called Jesus and said to him: 'You will have to go down to earth and suffer martyrdom to atone for the sin of man.' And Jesus said: 'I cannot do this. It is too much for me. Furthermore, why should I be offered up as atonement? Would it not be more just that the guilty should suffer for their sins? I have done no wrong, and this burden which You wish to place on my shoulders is too heavy for me and it is an undeserved punishment.' But God, though He listened patiently and with compassion, insisted: 'It has been decided and it must be so. I have decided and I cannot change my decision.' Are You not all-powerful?' Jesus said. 'Then why can't You change Your own decision?' I am indeed all-powerful, my son,' God answered him, 'and this is precisely the reason why, once I give my word, I may not reverse it. For if such revisions of my judgment were possible, then my decisions would not be eternal.' When Jesus heard this he wept and begged: 'Father, why do You do this to your only son? Why must I suffer the unbearable for the sake of the sins of men? Is it that You love mankind more than You love me? Surely You must love them more. else You would not visit the punishment due to them upon me.'</p>
<p>"When God heard these words, fiery tears rolled down His face and He cried out: 'Say no more. But it must be thus and cannot be any other way. Speak to me no more of this. I have decreed, and it must come to pass.'</p>
<p>" 'When must I suffer this martyrdom?' Jesus asked. 'Will it be soon? Can it not be delayed? Perhaps forever?'</p>
<p>"And God said: 'The day of your crucifixion has not yet been set.'</p>
<p>" 'Then do not set the day,' Jesus implored. 'You are the Lord of infinity. Let all time pass without setting the day. Whenever You think of Your decision to crucify me for the evil of mankind, postpone it.'</p>
<p>"Thus the argument went on for centuries, and each time God wept with remorse at His irrevocable decision to crucify his own only son, and postponed the fatal day for a while longer. But after some three thousand years passed in such arguments, God called Jesus and said: 'My son, wouldn't you rather have the crucifixion over with and reign in glory forever after, instead of having this doom hang over you?' And Jesus knew that the time had come and that his fate could no longer be put off. He wept before the throne of glory and said: 'If the time has come and can indeed not be post­poned any longer, then I will do as You order me. But I would have You know that were it up to me I would rather have this fate hang over me forever than face my ordeal, for the few minutes on the cross will be worse than eternal suspense. And furthermore, since it is Your will, it must be done, but I still do not see the reason for sacrificing me to atone for the sins of men; and, who knows, after I am crucified, the bitterness of my suffering may cloud forever the enjoyment of my reign in heaven.'</p>
<p>" 'Is there then no love for mankind in your heart?' God asked softly.</p>
<p>"But instead of answering this question Jesus retorted with another: 'Have You then no love for me, that You make me suffer this great anguish for something which I did not do?'</p>
<p>"And God could find no answer to it.</p>
<p>" 'Now, then,' Jesus said, 'I will go down to earth and I will be as brave about it as I can, and I will tell people what You want me to tell them. But in my heart I will not know why I was chosen nor why redemption must come by way of the cross, why grace cannot descend on mankind like a gentle breeze but must be steeped in blood.'</p>
<p>"And thus it happened, fellows, that Jesus was born on earth in Bethle­hem that is in Judea, and he knew what he had to do, and he was full of love and wanted to redeem mankind, but he did not understand why it had to be done through the cross. That is why, when he lived on earth, there were times when he was gentle and kind and all-forgiving; and there were other times, when he thought of the agony awaiting him, that he became angry, and it was at such moments that he wielded the whip on the money. changers in the Temple, or declared that he had come to bring not peace but the sword. For he was bitter at heart. But do not think, fellows, do not think for one moment that he did not believe in his mission, or that he did not love mankind enough to want to save them. He most certainly did. But since he was the Son of Man, he knew the meaning of agony and he experi­enced the foretaste of the suffering in store for him every minute that he was on earth.</p>
<p>"I know," Jacob continued feverishly, "that, like me, many of you must have wondered why Jesus was so weak in his last moments. I know that many of you must have asked the same question that I asked many times: Why, when on the cross, didn't Jesus say to his followers, 'At them, men! Strike them hard! Mow them down! Show them the true light that they should know and believe.' Why didn't he give some sign of his real nature? And couldn't he scorn a few nails in his hands and feet? Surely you don't think it was because he couldn't take it? Surely you don't believe he was cowed by the pain some Roman buck privates and a corporal could inflict?</p>
<p>"But in this there is a great mystery and a great light and a great despair. For when Jesus was hoisted on the cross between two thieves, doubt entered his mind. 'If these two thieves,' he said to himself, 'are also being crucified and are undergoing the same torments as I am, then wherewith am I atoning for the sins of man?' At that moment he foresaw that mankind would per­severe in crucifying itself and in crucifying one another to the end of time despite his Passion, and seeing that this was to be so, he rightly concluded that mankind's guilt would not be expiated by his suffering. This is the mystery, that he knew he was a man, and suffering like a man, and thus incapable of warding off suffering from the thieves at his side or from any­one throughout the generations. And he saw by a great light that all men at all times would have to endure the same, each in his generation and according to the customs and manners of the age. It was then he realized that he had been abandoned and he cried out: 'Why hast Thou forsaken me?' for the despair that entered him was infinite.</p>
<p>"Now, fellows, you understand what really happened almost two thou­sand years ago, and having this knowledge, when you next go on the bayonet course, you will . . ."</p>
<p>At this point Jacob's hands shook so violently that he could no longer write legibly. He made a few wild strokes on the paper and put down his pencil. He shook all over with the knowledge of great despair and fear. In this condition he was found by the men returning from the mess hall. They crowded around him and their remarks wandered between cynicism and compassion.</p>
<p>"What's the matter with our Jake?"</p>
<p>"Look at him shake!"</p>
<p>"Snap out of it, fella; what's the matter with you?"</p>
<p>"Section Eigh-h-h-ht," someone roared to the wide world.</p>
<p>"Sure looks like our Jake is getting out."</p>
<p>"Faking I bet."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah? You try and shake like that."</p>
<p>"What's he mumbling?"</p>
<p>"Can't make it out. Better get the medic."</p>
<p>Mess kit rattling, the medic briefly looked at Jacob. "Better take him to the hospital. Give me a hand, somebody."</p>
<p>"Hey, medic, what is it?"</p>
<p>"Looks like it all right."</p>
<p>"Section eight?"</p>
<p>"You said it."</p>
<p>"What's that on the papers? Let's see what he wrote."</p>
<p>"Lay off. Who told you you can read? The papers go to the hospital too."</p>
<p>Jacob rose submissively. He let them lead him by the arms. His mood was one of prayerful desperation. After the sermon he felt he had to pray. But only the words "In Your terrific righteousness" circled in his head. He wanted to bow to the ground, to beat his forehead against the gravel and to repeat these words as the ultimate appeal, but instead he obeyed the gentle pressure of his two guides.</p>
<p>It was only much later, after weeks of concentrated mental effort in the hospital, that he formulated his prayer.</p>

<p class=subtitle>VIII. Jacob's Prayer</p>
<p>In Your terrific righteousness, protect me,	Please, God, </p>
<p>From the raging bull in the unfenced pasture;	Just this one time more.</p>
<p>From the vicious dog not on a leash;	If You do it this time,</p>
<p>From the bully on the corner when no one is around,	I'll promise anything, </p>
<p>From the bully on the corner when many are around;	Not as at other times. </p>
<p>From the man in the street whose intentions are unknown;	I believe in You; </p>
<p>From the cat bent on murder;	This time I really do.</p>
<p>From the runaway horse;	The other times I am sorry about,</p>
<p>From the spider in the corner;	And I will never retract again,</p>
<p>From the beam that is leaning to fall;	I will never renege again,</p>
<p>From the stone that is loose to drop;	I will never again stray.</p>
<p>From things I don't see but know that they are,	I know I don’t deserve it.</p>
<p>From things I do see but know they are not;	I don’t even pretend that I do.</p>
<p>From the evil that may break out any time	But You should be generous.</p>
<p>To find me without defense or alibi;	You can never forget,</p>
<p>From effective wrath and from im­potent rage;	But can’t You ever forgive?</p>
<p>From the rim of the whirlpool,	I know You can’t,</p>
<p>From the bottom of the sea;	But please try, anyway,</p>
<p>From the terror that is crouching,	Or what am I to do?</p>
<p>And the horror that has leaped.	Try for the sake of . . .</p>
<p>For my weakness arouses them,	Abraham? No?</p>
<p>The smell of my fear increases their rage,	Isaac? No?</p>
<p>The odor of my blood enhances their lust,	Jacob? No?</p>
<p>The aroma of my dread lends spring to their leap,	The unknown soldier? No?</p>
<p>My meekness increases their anger,	A child that is lost in a crowd?</p>
<p>My mildness sharpens their claws,	A calf abandoned by its mother?</p>
<p>My compassion causes them to drool;	A bird that fell out of its nest?</p>
<p>My strength challenges them,	Then do it for the sake of anything You choose!</p>
<p>My aloneness invites.	My God? What if He doesn’t?</p>

<p>Jacob sat on his hospital cot mumbling quietly. Two attendants entered and walked down the length of the ward. They stopped before Jacob.</p>
<p>1st Attendant: This is a quiet one.</p>
<p>2nd Attendant: Yeah. Listen, he is mumbling something.</p>
<p>1st Attendant: What's he saying?</p>
<p>2nd Attendant: Can't make any sense out of it. Sounds like some prayer.</p>
<p>1st Attendant: He's nuts all right. Most of them are.</p>
<p>2nd Attendant: Most?</p>
<p>1st Attendant: Yeah, some are wise guys, just goldbricking.</p>
<p>2nd Attendant: What about the others, I mean the real ones, what makes them like this?</p>
<p>1st Attendant: Makes them? Nothing makes them. They just are that way, square pegs, misfits.</p>
<p>2nd Attendant: Misfits?</p>
<p>1st Attendant: Yeah, they don't belong.</p>
<p>2nd Attendant: Yeah, I guess that's it. They don't belong.</p>
