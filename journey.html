    <h1>The Journey</h1>
<p>It had become a habit. Every morning before I got up to go to work I would lie in bed for a while and look out on the wall opposite my window. The wall was only a few feet away. The window of my room over­looked a narrow alley. And as I would lie like this before getting dressed, I'd count the bricks of the section of wall which I could see. I could only see a small part, and by the time I decided to undertake the journey about which I will tell you, I got to know every one of them and even their individual markings. Three vertical streaks of greyish white had long ago trickled down from above. As I lay in bed I couldn't see where the streaks began. Some of the bricks were also chipped.</p>
<p>I know you think it is silly and, well, from a certain point of view, from a certain specialized point of view, it may appear silly to make friends of the bricks in a wall. But there are also other ways of looking at it. I do not care to force my, opinion on other people but I do expect them to see my side of the matter and to realize that it wasn't entirely silly.</p>
<p>I also want to say that bricks were not my only entertainment in the room. For quite a while, before I began counting the bricks regularly, I used to play a game of a sort, a very intellectual game if I may say so, with the pattern on the wallpaper. I developed some theories on the basis of that pattern, some of them quite interesting and even significant. I had thought of writing some of them down and explaining them and some day, when I find the time, I will do so.</p>
<p>You see, I have quite a lot of free time, mornings before I go to work and evenings after work and weekends and holidays. For although I like people and take an interest in things I nevertheless spend a lot of time by myself, thinking and generally improving my mind. Sometimes I read, but recently I haven't been doing much of that. And so, as I said, I have a lot of free time and I began taking an interest in the pattern of the wallpaper and I found it very instructive.</p>
<p>I discovered that the patterns had definite philosophical and emo­tional meaning. For instance, there was the thin pink line that weaved in and out of the general pattern. I named it "the irresponsible" because it just ambled along cheerfully without any obvious purpose. Then there was the part of the pattern which I named "frustration" because it went up and down, up and down, and it no sooner reached a certain point then it dropped again. There was also the "reactionary." This was a thin flower design that avoided the main pattern and whenever the latter bent to the right it bent to the left, and vice versa, just simply a contrary and unsocial ele­ment in the design.</p>
<p>There were times when I also felt that the entire design was like a musical composition and I tried to make up tunes to fit it. But that proved to be too complicated because a single tune would correspond only to one element of the design, and I lacked the training to work out the necessary parts for different instruments to correspond with the entire pattern.</p>
<p>But the really dramatic part was in the corner where two walls adjoin. When the room was papered they didn't take sufficient care to make the pat­tern follow in an unbroken line and there was a drop of about six inches from one wall to the other. This created a sort of waterfall, a cataract of design and of melody that tumbled down. The result was not pleasant esthetically and therefore I decided never to concentrate on more than one wall at a time.</p>
<p>As I said before I developed some very interesting theories about how the various elements, such as "reaction" and "frustration" and the others, could be combined into a whole and how it was possible to work out a formula that would hold good for all the arts and sciences. This theory is too complicated to be explained here and I only mention it to show that my interests were really very serious and intellectual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the bricks it was a different matter and more fun in many ways. When the window shade was down to a couple of inches from the sill, I could see only a few rows of them. I like counting things. I am a bookkeeper by profession and I like my work very much. I have been a bookkeeper for almost thirty years, not out of necessity but mainly because I enjoy the work, because it is so orderly and systematic. I think that a nice column of figures, evenly spaced and correctly added has a certain dynamism about it, like the rows of windows in a skyscraper, let us say. And that is why I have always had a tendency to count things. I used to count the number of stories in buildings I passed, the number of cement squares in the side­walks of the city blocks, the number of cars parked along the curb between two points.</p>
<p>I began counting the bricks in the wall opposite my window a long time ago. At first I did it simply out of curiosity, to see how many there were. Gradually I began to notice them more carefully and each of them acquired an individual character. I liked some better than others. A few I disliked altogether. Eventually I gave them names. I did not give them these names at random. There was a resemblance between each brick and the person after whom I named it. One of the bricks with the white streak on it I named after a man in my office who almost always suffers from a cold. Another one, with a crack in the plaster all around it, like a partition separating it from the rest, I named J. H., that's my boss; we always refer to him by his initials, not in his presence, that is. One chipped one I called "the vet," and one half brick that had been built in among the others I simply called "shrimp."</p>
<p>We got along very well together. I invented histories for them and I made up imaginary conversations among them. They also helped me follow current events and keep informed about what went on in the world. During the war, for instance, I named some of the bricks after Churchill and Roosevelt and Patton and Stalin and Bulganin. "Well, Bulgy," I'd say-- that was Bulganin--"won't we give the Nazis hell today?" Or, I'd lie in bed some Sunday afternoon and I'd say, "Winnie, let's get down to brass tacks, how about that second front:" We'd talk like this back and forth and discuss matters until I saw things straight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But I also have many friends, I mean people, real people. I wouldn't want the impression to get around that I lead a lonely life or that I am left out of things. I will not talk now about the people I know outside. But even in this house I have friends, two very good friends on the same floor with me and only a couple of doors away.</p>
<p>First there is Eddie. We always call him Eddie despite the fact that he must be nearly sixty years old. Naturally, we never asked him. It wouldn't be polite and it might hurt his feelings. He might get to thinking that he was an old man. We call him Eddie because he is so small and because we like him. I have known Eddie about fifteen years, and I met him almost as soon as I moved into the house. Nobody introduced us. I met him in the hall. It was dark. A fuse had blown and the superintendent was slow about replacing it. We didn't really meet; we stumbled against each other. He then invited me to come into his room. I must say I was surprised when I first came in. There was a big dressing table in his room and it was literally covered with all sorts of little bottles of per­fume and nail polish and hair oil and things like that. I have never before known a man who took such perfect care of himself.</p>
<p>Well, Eddie and I talked for a while and we got acquainted, and he asked me if I played checkers, and I said yes, and he said he had a board but he didn't have all the pieces. But we played a game just the same. We used some of the little bottles on his dresser. And that's how we became friends and we have been friends ever since. Sometimes we play. checkers and sometimes we discuss politics. Eddie is a very smart man. Or we go for a short walk and stop at the cafeteria on the corner and I have a cup of coffee and Eddie has some tea or a bottle of soda. Eddie doesn't drink coffee.</p>
<p>I like this cafeteria. I used to have my breakfast in it nearly every morning since I moved into the house where I live. It's a quiet place and not expensive. At first I had some arguments with the counter­man but now he and I are fast friends. The argument was about a small matter but one that I took seriously. You see, whenever possible I always use the same seat, near the register close to the door so that I could see what goes on Outside. I like to watch people. I am also very neat. The counter at this spot was cracked and at first I complained to the counter­man that there was a lot of dirt in the crack. He was not very courteous about it in the beginning, I must say, and he told me that I should move further down the counter. But in time we reached an understanding and I didn't mind it any more. As a matter of fact I found it interesting. The crack was quite wide at the edge and narrowed as it wiggled to the other edge. There was another crack branching off from the middle. I discovered that the two cracks resembled the Mississippi and Missouri rivers in their general outlines and then I used to have a lot of fun studying them. I would locate the main cities on these rivers with small crumbs. I would imagine myself piloting a boat on the Mississippi, or hunting buffalo some­where near the Missouri. I didn't indulge only in idle fancy either. There was all that-talk in the papers about the TVA and about establishing authorities to develop the Columbia and Colorado and other rivers. I spent many hours planning what could be done to control the Mississippi and the Missouri and to prevent floods and to irrigate deserts. I did a lot of figuring too because I like to work with figures and somewhere in my room I have a whole sheaf of papers about these two rivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides Eddie there is my other friend in the house, Miss Marybelle. She is a very fine person and we became friends right away. It happened this way: Miss Marybelle has a cat named Susabelle. She said she named it after her two aunts who had died and left her a small legacy. One of the aunts was named Susan and the other Annabelle. Shortly after I moved into the house about fifteen years ago . I met Miss Marybelle in the hall and she nodded and smiled, and I nodded back, and a few days later it hap­pened to be raining and she knocked on my door and asked me whether I wouldn't run down to the butcher shop and get some liver for her cat see­ing as she had a cold and couldn't go out. It was then she told me what a wonderful animal the cat was and how much company it was to her and all about her aunts and the legacy they left her. I ran down and got the liver and she invited me to come in and offered me some tea—she has a small electric plate in her room and she does her own housekeeping she said. It was all very cozy and we became friends. Sometimes Miss Marybelle and Eddie and I have a little party in her room. Eddie and I play checkers and Miss Marybelle prepares some tea which Eddie also drinks, though he can't drink coffee. She says it's nice to have friends, men friends, around, even though she finds that Susabelle is such a comfort to her. Miss Mary-belle likes Eddie, but I often think she likes me more, and that is not surprising because I am younger than Eddie and we have much more in common. She often tells me that she admires a steady person like myself with a regular job and good habits, and she said that a woman of her gentle temper, and with a legacy, would make a fine companion for a man of sober character. I agree with her and we see each other often. More recently she even told me once that though a cat like Susabelle is a great comfort she sometimes thinks that people need steady human companionship. I quite understood her because though her present cat is also named Susabelle it is not the same that she had at the time I met her. That one died a natural death a few years later and Miss Marybelle already had two other cats which finished their natural lives. But she calls all her cats Susabelle on account of her aunts to whom she is very grateful for the legacy they left her. And naturally she can't feel as strongly about the present cat as she did about the first one, or even the second one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had been content all along. It was only natural that I should be, with so many intellectual and social diversions and interests. That was so until about a year ago. I really don't know what happened then. So far as I can remember nothing in particular happened. But all of a sudden I began to feel not quite as happy and content as I used to be. It was all very vague, just a strange feeling of discontent. I even became impatient and irritated with my good friends and I always felt bad after I had been rude to them. I don't mean that I was really rude, just a little bit impatient, and the chief trouble was that I didn't know what I was impatient about, for I continued doing the same work and I ate the same kind of food and saw the same friends and indulged my usual interests in politics and philosophy and current events.</p>
<p>This lasted for quite a while and then things got really bad. I lost my appetite and, what was still worse, I began making mistakes in my work. It is important to understand that in my type of work mistakes are serious matters--they are much more than mere errors. Of course, people who know nothing about bookkeeping probably think it is a simple matter to correct an error. It really isn't. It is not difficult to detect the mistake and to make the necessary correction. But when that happens the whole day is spoiled. I find it hard to explain but it is as if a violinist should make a mistake while playing something very moving and have to start all over again to correct the false note. The entire rendition is spoiled.</p>
<p>And then I began having nightmares. Never before in my life did I have nightmares. I had always led such a sober and sensible life and my sleep had always been undisturbed. It worried me. I was afraid I was getting sick and I did not know the reason for it. Mostly the nightmares had to do with my work. I would feel a great compulsion to put down some wrong figures in the books and then run. J. H., that's my boss, would run after me with some weapon which I never saw because he was always behind me and I knew that if he would catch up with me he would kill me. I always woke up just as he was about to catch me.</p>
<p>I didn't care to tell anyone, but people in the office began notic­ing it. Some people there even remarked that what I needed was a change and suggested that maybe I should take a trip. I told Miss Marybelle what they said and she seemed to agree with them. She was quite enthusiastic and said that she had been thinking for a long time that I needed a change but was too reticent about telling me. She said I needed to do something drastic "It's not the right way to live," she said, "with only Eddie and his checkerboard for relaxation." I was surprised when she said that because I liked Eddie a lot and I always thought that she liked him too. She said that she too felt a great need for some drastic change, something romantic and drastic at the same time, and that there were times when even Susabelle was not enough to keep a vital person with a small legacy like herself com­pletely happy.</p>
<p>It got to be so that for the first time I felt displeased with the people in the office, with the counterman in the cafeteria and even with my room which I had always felt was peaceful and homey. I'd get up in the morning and look out of the window at the wall. But instead of finding it soothing as I had for so many years, I would be annoyed with it and with the discolored bricks and with the streaks running down. I'd lie in bed and count the bricks, one whole one, another one, a third, then one that was chipped, then another whole one and so on, just as I used to do for a long time, but it wasn't relaxing at all any more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also told Eddie about my state of mind, but naturally I did not tell him what Miss Marybelle said about him and his checkerboard. Eddie was very understanding. He thought for a long time and then he said, "Yes, you ought to do something about it." "What?" I asked him. He thought again for quite a while. Eddie is a sensible and level-headed person and never jumps at conclusions. "Well, I'll tell you," he finally said, "you ought to do something different from what you have been doing all along." He thought some more and then he said, "What you need is a change; yes, that's what you need, a change."</p>
<p>I was glad to hear Eddie say it because I was beginning to think so myself and I always had a high regard for Eddie's opinion.</p>
<p>"What kind of a change would you suggest?" I asked him.</p>
<p>He didn't answer right away. He said this was a very serious matter and required considerable thought, but he promised me that he would think about it and let me know what his suggestion would be.</p>
<p>Several weeks passed and all this time I was in a state of indecision. I was so upset that there were times when I was positively feverish. I talked with some of the people in the office and they kept urging me to take a trip. "What you need," they said, "is not just any kind of a trip. You need a long trip, a real journey, that would take you far away from here for a long time and would freshen you up." I asked them for suggestions and some recommended Cuba, others suggested Brazil, and one man even said that a trip to Alaska would be just the thing. "A trip like that would really break the monotony and get you out of the rut," he said.</p>
<p>They are all fine people and their suggestions were very sincere, which just goes to prove that I had many good friends.</p>
<p>I turned these suggestions over in my mind and I thought they were very sensible, as suggestions I mean, but that they were not very practical. What would be the use, I thought, of traveling around in foreign countries where I wouldn't even understand the language and I wouldn't know where to go or where to find food and where to stay at night? I would feel lost, sort of, and that would make me still more nervous and affect my appetite and cause me to lose sleep. And even if I were to go to Alaska where I would know the language, I didn't see much point to it because it is so far away and cold and there aren't hardly any people there, yet I am sociable by nature. Besides, I have always been a quiet person of steady habits and I was afraid that a fly-by-night sort of existence would not be the thing for me at all. My friends in the office meant well with their suggestions but they apparently didn't really understand me and the kind of man I really am.</p>
<p>Then one evening Eddie came in to see me. I was glad to see him because I knew that he understood me completely and that he must have thought over the matter and made up his mind what I should do. He didn't get right to the subject. Eddie always takes his time, and I appreciate this trait in him because it shows lack of that kind of haste which can make a man regret his actions when it is too late.</p>
<p>After a while he said: "Many years ago I was in a condition similar to yours. That was a very long time ago. I then decided to do something about it. Yod know me that I don't like to exaggerate or to use big words to describe something, but don't be surprised when I tell you that I then decided to do something revolutionary, because that's exactly what I did. I left my home town and came here, to this city. And let me tell you, I never regretted the step. Here I found contentment and I regained my peace of mind, as you have seen for yourself since we got to know each other. Of course, I don't mean to say that you have to take quite such a radical step as I did. Drastic measures can boomerang," he said, and he smiled when he said that. Eddie can be very vivid in his talk when he wants to. I understood perfectly what he meant.</p>
<p>"I have thought about your situation a great deal," he went on, "and I have come to the conclusion that what you really need is a change' yes, that's what you need, a change."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My mind was made up then and almost at once I felt a great differ­ence come over me. I was in a state of elated anticipation. You know how people are excited when they have made up their minds to a great ven­ture. In my case it was much more so, for though I knew that any day I would make the great change, I did not know yet what it was going to be. I was absentminded and jittery. I was still making mistakes in my work and my appetite remained bad. But it was altogether different than before. I was so tense I could scarcely sleep nights. I knew that I would not do anything drastic because it was just as Eddie said--drastic measures can boomerang. All the same I was convinced that a profound change would take place.</p>
<p>I am frequently surprised at how really important changes occur without one's even thinking of them a minute before. Something like this happened to me. I got up one morning and without realizing what I was doing I went to have my breakfast in a different cafeteria from the one where I had been eating for years. It was the same kind of restaurant as the other one, with a counter running the length of it on one side and a row of tables along the other wall. Yet what a difference! Immediately I felt the change. The counterman was different, the cups and saucers were different, everything was different. It gave me a terrific boost. I felt as if I had become a new man and that everything would be much better from then on. It may sound far-fetched to you but it refreshed me and gave me a new slant on life. That very day I did not make a single mistake in my work. And to think that this cafeteria was less than a block away all the time.</p>
<p>I had been thinking for some time that I'd better tell the superin­tendent of the house where I live that I was about to make a change, but I could not bring myself to do it. Partly this may have been because I didn't know exactly what I was going to do, but mainly it was because I didn't want to be rash. So I kept postponing it. But on this day I felt so vigorous and determined that I talked to the superintendent when I returned from work. It happened almost by accident, but if I hadn't felt so refreshed I am sure I would not have talked to him about it.</p>
<p>As I came into the hall on my way from work the superintendent was there fixing something and before I knew it I had told him that I had decided to make a change. He didn't seem surprised at all. "I can fix you up," he said and ran down to the basement where he has a room. He came back in a minute with his bunch of keys. "I have just the thing for you," he said, "and it's the kind of change that anybody in his right senses would dump at." It all happened in an instant before I realized what it was all about. He took me to a room at the other end of the house, on the same floor where I had been living. "It's newly painted," he said, "and it's got a southern exposure." He was right. The window in this room faced South whereas the one in my previous room had faced North and there was never much sunlight coming in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That evening was hectic. I had to move my things to the new place the full length of the hall. But before I began to move them I naturally told Miss Marybelle and Eddie about it. They were both almost as excited as I was. Eddie didn't say very much but by the pleased look on his face I could tell that he approved the step I had taken. Miss Marybelle posi­tively beamed and said outright that I had done well, that it would have been bad to part from friends and go far away among strangers. "A man needs companionship," she said, and I agree with her. Then and there we decided to hold a little party in the room I was leaving--a bon voyage party Miss Marybelle called it. She prepared tea and I ran down and bought some cake and some soda. The soda was for Eddie because of late he had been complaining the tea was having a bad effect on his heart. It was a gay party, almost like the sort people have when they go to Europe. Eddie suggested a game of checkers after the tea but this time I said no, because there was so much to do moving my things, and Miss Marybelle agreed with me and told him to forget his silly checkers on an important occasion like this.</p>
<p>It took me all of two hours to pack and move the things. Eddie helped a little and Miss Marybelle supervised and told me how to arrange the things. When it was finished we were all nearly exhausted. Eddie went to his rdom to lie down to rest. Miss Marybelle stayed a little longer and assured me that she thought I had done right and that she was very glad I had not taken a really long journey. "Susabelle is a great comfort to me," she said, "but how can she take the place of the company of an intelligent, energetic and sober man like you?" She said she wouldn't have known what to do had I been so rash as to leave the house altogether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some months have now passed since I made the great change. Once more I feel contented and well. My sleep is undisturbed. I make no mis­takes at work. When I wake up in the morning the sun shines brightly into my room which is smaller than the previous one but much more cheerful. Here, too, the wall of the adjoining house is only a few feet away, but it is built differently and the arrangement of the bricks is not the same as in the other one. I have already become familiar with them and as I lie in bed in the morning and look at the part of the wall that I can see between the window shade and the sill, I realize that it is an entirely different arrangement. The chipped ones are not in the same location and everything is fundamentally different.</p>
<p>I have never gone back to the old cafeteria, and now I always take my breakfast in the new place I have discovered down the street. Here, too, I had a little misunderstanding with the counterman at first, but it is all straightened out now. This time also it was about a crack in the marble top of the counter which accumulates dirt. But this one is entirely different. It is wider than the other and runs in almost a straight line the full width of the counter. When I have my dinner after work and I am not rushed for time, I like to think that it resembles the Hudson River. Miss Marybelle has always been saying that I have a lot of imagination. I locate the cities along the Hudson with crumbs of bread and I like to fancy that I go on a boat to Bear Mountain, or maybe even as far as Albany.</p>
