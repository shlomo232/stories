    <h1>The Final Conflict</h1>
    <p>Now, in 1999, the First Atomic War has long been a matter of history. It took place well over thirty years ago. The libraries are full of books about that war, analyzing the battles, appraising the qualities of its out­standing commanders and giving detailed descriptions of the atrocities com­mitted by the enemy. Everybody believes these accounts, and it would be as much as my life, let alone my reputation, is worth to contradict them.</p>
<p>Though I know most of these beliefs are false, I have, of late, begun to doubt their falsehood. "Is it possible," I ask myself, "that I am the only one who knows the real truth? Is it conceivable that the entire world should be wrong and only I, Christopher Grantville, professor of history in one of the minor colleges of the country, should remember things as they actually happened? What is truth, anyway?" I often ask myself. "Isn't truth a relative concept, and that which is generally accepted is true? And is it not equally possible that it is I, who claim to remember the true sequence of events in the First Atomic War, who am laboring under a delusion, while all the rest, which means not only my colleagues, but everybody else in the world, are right?"</p>
<p>As I said above, these doubts have lately begun to trouble me ser­iously. If I do not take advantage of the clarity of my memory now, I may soon become unable to distinguish between truth and falsehood. I therefore decided to record the following account of the events as they occurred before my own vision becomes dimmed. I will leave this manuscript in a safe place with instructions that it should not be opened before the year 2100--perhaps by that time it will again be safe to reveal the truth. Were I to offer this account to the public now, it would at once be destroyed and I would most likely disappear mysteriously without trace, or at best be shouted down as a madman and confined to a lunatic asylum.</p>
<p>I will make this statement brief and deal only with essentials, for once these are known, humanity will easily be able to reconstruct the rest of the events as they happened and to interpret them correctly. And now I will begin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All through the latter half of the nineteen-fifties, humanity strove to avoid an atomic conflict, fearful that it might lead to the destruction, or at best to the total barbarization of the entire human race. Many inter­national conferences were held, and often it seemed as if an effective way had been found to outlaw atomic warfare. But after each upsurge of optimism, tensions between the Communist and Free countries mounted again and a new round of conferences was required merely to regain some of the ground that had been lost in the meantime. By the time the nineteen sixties came, humanity had become deeply convinced that there was no escaping an atomic war. Efforts were still made to postpone it but everybody felt that sooner or later it was bound to break out. This conviction became so overwhelming that a strange apathy prevailed and people did not care much any longer about the consequences of such a war. They were almost anxious for it to come and have it over with.</p>
<p>When the war finally did come, it therefore didn't surprise anyone. As had been predicted by all military experts, the first phase of the war was brief and devastating. Within two weeks, the thirty largest cities in the United States, and all major military installations, were wiped out. Similar havoc was wrought on the Communist side. The major allies of both the United States and Russia suffered in proportion. At the end of two weeks, industry everywhere had been so thoroughly destroyed or crippled that further atomic attack on the part of either side was out of the question.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should add at this point that, at the time, it was impos­sible to establish who began the war, for at the very moment when the first atomic mushroom rose over New York, a small broadcasting station near Mos­cow was picked up announcing that Moscow was being A-bombed. Later, of course, each side accused the other of starting the war, but for the sake of the record I feel it is necessary to make this point.</p>
<p>I do not feel it is necessary to describe in this brief document the havoc caused in this country: the smoldering cities, the caravans of people clogging all roads leading from the major population centers toward the countryside, the cries of the injured, the huge encampments that formed everywhere, the pollution of the water supplies along the roads, and the epidemics of dysentery and other diseases that followed in its train. All these things can well be imagined, and most of them are chronicled in the histories of that time with a fair degree of accuracy. Mob fought mob for food; the farmers armed themselves and resisted the hordes from the cities that swept over their fields and devoured or carried off every bit of food, leaving the land behind them bare as if they had been locusts instead of people.</p>
<p>There were also some natural phenomena of an unusual nature that were then noticed only casually. People were too busy trying to survive during the first months of the war to pay close attention to anything else, but those who did observed clouds of a pink hue at night, even when there was no moon and no apparent source for their illumination. The matter was casually dismissed as "radiation of some sort."</p>
<p>Gradually life assumed a semblance of organization. The war went on, of course, but with outmoded means. The army was reorganized to make it effective for combat without the specialized weapons formerly supplied by industry. The huge encampments were broken up and slowly distributed throughout the country. Life did not become as primitive as the prophets of doom had forecast; it reverted perhaps a century backward. Some trains ran on the few undamaged or quickly repaired railroads, but airplanes dis­appeared when the supplies of gasoline and spare parts were exhausted. Motor traffic was not entirely eliminated but was greatly reduced, and one could occasionally see strange vehicles that were quickly devised by the army to use wood, dry grass, alcohol and other simple and readily obtain­able fuels.</p>
<p>It was a strange existence, a way of life that resembled the middle of the nineteenth century, pocked here and there with the trappings of the second half of the twentieth. Thus, electric light and power became rare since all the large powerhouses had been destroyed and all the major dams were blasted in the first onslaught of the enemy. But here and there a small power station remained, or a new one was quickly set up along some small source of water power—that is, wherever necessary machinery could be salvaged from somewhere and laboriously brought to the spot. In the midst of this total regression, radio broadcasts remained a common feature. There were no entertainment programs, to be sure, and the Government used radio exclusively to urge the people on to greater war efforts and to stim­ulate their spirits.</p>
<p>I should perhaps point out that the broadcasts lost much of the old finesse. They were blunt and cruel, under the impact of the great suffer­ing that was experienced during the first weeks of the war, no doubt, and called for the complete destruction not only of the enemy's fighting forces, but of his entire way of life. The First Atomic War become a Holy War in which the losing side was to be converted to the principles of the victor or annihilated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For some months the propaganda war showed no unusual symptoms, aside, as I have stated, from its uncompromising violence. The Communist broad­casts, which were easily picked up on any short wave set, were equally ruthless.</p>
<p>And then a strange thing occurred, strange especially because it was scarcely noticed at first and was entirely disregarded almost immediately thereafter. A broadcast from Kansas, where the Government had taken refuge as soon as the war broke out, sounded a strange note. I heard it the first time under circumstances that were not unusual then. I and a group of colleagues, former teachers of history in various colleges, were lunching in a potato field. I should explain perhaps that we had been drafted to go over the extensive potato fields in our district carefully and pick up what­ever potatoes had been overlooked during the harvest. Winter was then im­pending, and the poor state of the nation's food reserves made this arrange­ment logical, especially since education, higher education in particular, was totally disorganized and professors and college teachers had little or no useful employment. As I said, we were lunching in the open potato field one day with only a tent for shelter in case of rain. But we did have a small battery-powered radio set with us. Newspapers had become a rarity and it was natural for us to take this set with us. After all, we were people accustomed to keeping informed about world events.</p>
<p>Thus it came about that as we cooked our lunch—which consisted of potatoes baked in an open pit—we turned on the radio. There was no news of significance: some ground had been lost on one front, and some enemy positions taken on another front in heavy hand-to-hand fighting. We knew that the war had settled down to a temporary stalemate, and as historians we were not specially concerned with the outcome of minor battles. We were finishing our lunch when the announcer began his concluding remarks. These were customarily of an uplifting and patriotic character and were read to the soft accompaniment of the national anthem. But this time they caught our attention and we looked at each other in amazement. The national anthem was played as background music but the speech was astounding, to say the least.</p>
<p>The announcer said: "We know that the people of the United States, loyal to the principles of liberty as they were so brilliantly expounded by our great Marxist teachers, Coolidge, Hoover and Garner, will spare them-sieves neither effort nor sacrifice in the struggle against the enemies of mankind who have set out to destroy the greatest achievement of the human race, the victorious building of socialism within these forty-eight states. All men and women, nay, even children and the aged who have honorably won the right to enjoy peacefully the blessings of socialism for which they so courageously fought and labored all their lives, will gladly leap to the fray to defend this fatherland of the workingman, this toilers' paradise that already extends from the rocky coast of socialist Maine to the sun-drenched fields of socialist California, from the brutal onslaught of the enemies of peace, the Kremlin imperialists who would destroy us to satisfy the greed of a handful of Russian capitalists."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The announcer continued in this vein for some time, but we no longer listened. We looked at each other in consternation. What could have hap­pened? Had the Communists, by some ruse, succeeded in invading this country at its very heart, in Kansas, whence the broadcast came? Or was it a case of fifth-columnists in the Government apparatus? The last seemed the most reasonable explanation and our consternation soon gave way to placid reassurance. It was a small matter. The enemy, to be sure, still had his agents everywhere. But our own FBI was constantly on their track, and if one fifth-columnist managed to insinuate a subversive speech into a broadcast he would be silenced soon enough. Thus reassured we started back to our work. And then the same idea seemed to strike us all at once for we suddenly stopped and looked at each other. It could not be an enemy agent momentarily insinuating his voice into an American broadcast. Why should the enemy speak of a socialist Maine and California? Why should he refer to Kremlin imperialists?</p>
<p>We did not articulate these questions; it was not necessary. A great dread suddenly seized upon us. Involuntarily I raised my eyes and looked upward, to the weird bluish clouds that had been scudding high in the sky ever since the deluge of atomic explosives hit the country early in the war.</p>
<p>My colleagues followed my involuntary movement and then exclaimed in unison: No, No," and fled each to his own potato row. I followed them.</p>
<p>The strange broadcast troubled us deeply all that day but we were afraid to talk about it. It could not be laughed off, neither was there</p>
<p>any reasonable explanation for it and, worst of all, we felt as if, con­fronted with it, we could not trust our own reason. There was something irrational about the broadcast as well as about our reaction to it. I for one decided to await future developments before reaching any conclusions.</p>
<p>Our work in the potato field lasted till it became too dark to con­tinue and we then returned to our respective homes. We were all very tired from the unaccustomed physical labor, and when I returned to my cubicle which had been assigned to me in an army-type barracks where some hundreds of people lived, I spoke to no one and soon feel asleep.</p>
<p>The next day we returned to our labors in the potato field. I ached to bring up the subject of the preceding day's broadcast, but my colleagues on either side of me were strangely reluctant to discuss the matter. At lunchtime I eagerly awaited the one o'clock broadcast. It brought a shat­tering surprise for me. As the announcer recounted the daily score of small victories and minor defeats on the various fronts, he exceeded his own per­formance of the previous day. Now he sounded like a stock-in-trade editorial from some Soviet paper. All the freshness and vigor had gone out of his speech and his words rattled dully like a memorized oration as he spoke of "the shock troops of the American socialist fatherland" who "inspired by the great example of our chief, the father of the oppressed everywhere, the liberator of the working masses of the world, President Charles Karl Marx Smith," and spurred on "by the great determination to smash the mad dogs of Moscow imperialism" bravely assaulted the enemy positions and, "without suffering a single casualty themselves, caused the destruction of three hundred of the enemy."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I looked at my colleagues and my spine tingled with terror. Their faces showed no trace of surprise. They placidly ate their baked potatoes. One of them nodded approvingly and muttered something about "the Russian capitalist swine."</p>
<p>I must have turned pale for one of them quickly walked over to me and asked solicitously, "What is the matter, Chris? Don't you feel well?"</p>
<p>"I feel fine," I shouted. "But the broadcast, that broadcast, and you, what is the matter with you?"</p>
<p>"The broadcast?" he asked in surprise. "What is the matter with it?" "What is the matter with it?" I screamed. "Are you all insane or something? You ask me what is the matter with it?"</p>
<p>He exchanged meaningful glances with the others and repeated his question: "Yes, Chris, what is the matter with it?"</p>
<p>"Are we Communists or are we Americans?" I lost my head altogether and shouted at the top of my lungs. "Are we fighting the Communist on­slaught to destroy the free world, or aren't we? And since when has our President, Charles Smith, become Charles 'Karl Marx' Smith?"</p>
<p>My colleagues gathered around me. Some looked at my sympathetically, others had a trace of suspicion in their eyes. "You tell us what you think of it all," one of them suggested slyly though gently. The others waited for me to speak.</p>
<p>I was about to say something but restrained myself. For no reason that I could give, I suddenly realized that they believed every word of the broadcast, and that they considered me somehow suspect for questioning it.</p>
<p>"Go on, please tell us what is troubling you about the broadcast," they urged me.</p>
<p>I felt confused and also fearful. I mistrusted them now. I realized that something terrible had happened to them, and also that they had become immune to reason. Were I to talk to them rationally they would only think that it was I who had gone insane. But I had been challenged and could not avoid giving some kind of answer. I therefore tried to straddle the question and to take no clear-cut position.</p>
<p>"I must have suffered a momentary lapse of memory," I said, formu­lating my remarks so that they could be construed either as agreement with them or as sarcasm, "for, surprisingly, I had forgotten that our President's middles names were Karl Marx. Now isn't that strange?"</p>
<p>"And what did you think was our President's middle name?" they ques­tioned me suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Believe it or not," I hedged, " I had completely forgotten that our great President had a middle name at all."</p>
<p>"And now that you have refreshed your memory," they pursued me relent­lessly, "what do you think of 'Karl Marx' as a middle name for our President? Do you think it is a suitable name?"</p>
<p>I was momentarily nonplussed and could think of no way to reply with­out committing myself. "As a historian I am of course aware of the tremen­dous effect which Karl Marx had on the course of history," I began hesi­tantly, "but . . . "</p>
<p>"But what, Chris?" They would not desist.</p>
<p>I decided to make a final test, happen what may. "But it seems strange to me that until this day none of us had ever heard that President Smith had a middle name and that it was Karl Marx, and need I tell you that it not a suitable name for the leader of a free country dedicated to the principles of freedom and to a relentless struggle against Communist totalitarianism?"</p>
<p>They provided their answer without words. Gently two of my colleagues led me by the arms into the tent we had in the field. "You'd better lie down and rest," they said kindly as they helped me onto the cot we had there. I submitted readily. Physical resistance was pointless, and intellectual resistance seemed hopeless. My friends, intellectual people trained to think clearly and objectively, had undergone a strange transformation. It was evident: they had become Communists. But that wasn't all. Judging from the broadcast, the entire country and the Government had also become Com­munist and were convinced that these United States were a Soviet country and that Russia, Soviet Russia, was a capitalist nation. It was pointless to argue with my friends. Thoughts madly raced through my head: How could that have come about? It was almost supernatural, and as a historian I did not believe in the supernatural.</p>
<p>My friends were in a huddle outside the tent door. They were talking about me; I could see that from the way they frequently looked in my direc­tion. Involuntarily my eyes looked to the patch of sky visible through the tent door, and to the bluish remote clouds. This was the only explanation, far-fetched and unlikely though it seemed. These radiation clouds had the power to transform the mentality of a nation. They not only caused physi­cal havoc at the moment of their release; they also infected the nation with the ideology of those who made the bombs that released them. Here was devil's work indeed.</p>
<p>For an unaccountable reason I was convinced that this was the true explanation, but having been trained for so many years to check my conclu­sions, I decided to do so also in this instance. Besides, there remained some major questions unanswered. If the radiation clouds from the Soviet H bombs that destroyed so much of the United States had the strange power of brainwashing an entire country and converting it into a Communist land, how did it happen that I escaped its effect? And wasn't I rash to conclude that everybody in the United States had suffered the same effects, on the basis of the evidence which I saw in my colleagues and in the Government broadcasts? And even so far as my colleagues were concerned, was the evi­dence conclusive? Should I not wait for further confirmation of their new mentality?</p>
<p>The answer to the last question was given me even as I lay on the cot thinking these strange thoughts, for a few minutes later I heard them debate heatedly. "This is all due to the lack of sufficient socialist indoctrination and laxity of Communish discipline," one of my colleagues was saying. "Academician Jones is right," another seconded him firmly. "The capitalist enemy is always lurking in the background, seeking an opportunity to do his dirty wrecking. We must strengthen our-Bolshevik self-criticism. We have been remiss in the struggle against the imperialist enemy. We must at once elect a political commissar to look after the Bolshevik purity of our cell of potato pickers."</p>
<p>The others agreed to the suggestion. I did not listen to them any more. They had provided the final answer to one of my questions. Now I had only two more tests to make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That night, when all my neighbors were deep in sleep, I cautiously turned on our barracks radio to the Russian short wave frequency. It was two o'clock in the morning. In European Russia it was therefore nine o'clock in the morning and I should have no difficulty picking up some broadcast. I kept the volume low not to awaken any of the people in the barracks. I did not have to wait long. Soon I found an English language broadcast beamed to the United States from Skotoprigonievsk on the upper reaches of the Volga. It confirmed my worst suspicions.</p>
<p>The announcer, who spoke with a strong accent, sonorously declaimed: "The people of Russia, living happily under the blessings of democracy, freedom and individual rights, will never forget, nor ever forgive the treacherous Communist American enemy who, having failed to subvert our age-old Russian liberties by wile, has resorted to the use of brutal force in an attempt to impose his vile dictatorship upon us. Free men never surrender, and the people of Russia, blessed with freedom, will fight on to the final hour of triumph, when our brave soldiers of liberty, our modern Minute Men, will light the great torch of liberty on the continent of Amer­ica to shed its light from the sandy beaches of North Carolina to the dark­est forests of Oregon, and free the oppressed millions who now groan under the iron heel of the worst dictator mankind has known, Charles Karl Marx Smith.</p>
<p>Quietly I turned off the radio and returned to my bunk. My worst fears had been confirmed. The radiation of American bombs had had the same effect on the Russians as theirs had on us. It was not really necessary to make any further tests. The facts of the situation were altogether too obvious and gruesomely ludicrous.</p>
<p>But further confirmation came, though I did not seek it. The follow­ing morning all the inmates of my barracks were told to report to a general meeting at seven o'clock before going out to work. One of my colleagues, the one who had been addressed the previous day as "Academician Jones," talked to the gathering. He did not mince words. "Comrades," he began, "the enemy is ruthless and the tentacles of his destructive work extend everywhere. We must ever be on guard. Old and young must be on the alert against his intrigues, for now that the imperalist aggressors in Moscow have learned that they cannot subjugate us by force they will do every­thing in their power to undermine our socialist faith from within with all kinds of reactionary notions. Indeed, I have grounds to believe that the enemy's influence has already succeeded in penetrating our very midst."</p>
<p>At this point he looked in my direction and I blanched, but he did not further identify me and continued with his oration.</p>
<p>"It has therefore been decided by the Soviet of this barracks, of which I am now chairman, that henceforth all remarks of a hostile nature are to be reported to it without delay, even if it should be necessary to interrupt important work to do so. Anyone--and I mean everyone without exception and without regard to age--who fails to report all manifestations of Russian imperialist influences will be tried before the Extraordinary Commission which we appointed last night. And now everyone will report to his work. Beginning today we are introducing the system of socialist com­petition and food rations will be issued in accordance with the amount of work performed and with the number of enemies of the people reported to the Soviet."</p>
<p>After the meeting I reported myself ill and spent the rest of the day in my bunk thinking. I had all the evidence I wanted, and still I re­fused to believe what I had seen and heard. My mind refused to assimilate the new state of affairs which flew in the face of reality.</p>
<p>The following day I begged permission from the barracks Soviet to visit the neighboring town. I said I needed a day of relaxation before re­turning to work in the potato field. My request was readily granted. I watched the clerk of the Soviet as he made the entry into the books. He wrote: "Comrade Christopher Grantville is hereby given leave to visit town for purposes of relaxation in accordance with the rule that members of the academic professions, who as non-producers are more likely to succumb to the strains of the war of socialist liberation, should be granted exceptional leave privileges when conditions require them."</p>
<p>I walked to the town which was about five miles away. Along the road I was frequently greeted with the outstretched fist by groups of people working in the fields. I returned their greetings in the same manner. The name of the town had been Forkville and at the town limits there had been the usual sign, "You are now entering Forkville. Population 6,789. Protect our children." This sign had been freshly painted over and now bore the legend: "You are now engering Engelsville. Win the War Against Imperalist Aggression." I went directly to the town's public library. I found it locked. A crudely printed leaflet was tacked on the door. I did not stop to read it. I could guess its contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than thirty years have passed. All traces of the past have been eradicated long ago. The country has been rebuilt and our United Socialist States of America is now again heavily industrialized. The Free Federal Republic of Russia has also recovered from the devastation of three decades ago. There still are no diplomatic relations between the two.</p>
<p>The world remains divided though the fighting has ceased. The strange radiation clouds dissipated some years after the First Atomic War, and they are not mentioned in any of the war records.</p>
<p>I am now an old man in the seventies, the only one who miraculously escaped the radiation effects and who remembers events as they truly occurred. I am writing this record for a future generation. I do so not merely for the sake of objective truth, though as a historian I am natu­rally devoted to it. I am impelled by more important considerations. The world has managed to rebuilt its ruins without knowing the truth. But there has been talk lately that this country will soon again be in a posi­tion to make atomic weapons with which it will be possible to defeat Russia "and liberate the Russian workers and the oppressed colonies of Russian imperialism from the yoke of the Kremlin warmongers." It is not improbable that we will soon be able to build atom bombs. Remembering the past, I am convinced that present-day Russia with its free institutions will at least keep abreast of us in this regard. And then?</p>
<p>I know that for the sake of humanity I should shout my knowledge from the roof tops, but I also know that were I to do so I would be looked up as a lunatic, if not condemned to a worse fate.</p>
