    <h1>The Sorrows of Old Werther</h1>
    <p class=topnote>[The New Republic, December 18, 1976, pp. 16-19]</p>
<p>Mind you, I am not complaining.</p>
<p>Why should I complain? Who are we SS'ers—Social. Security beneficiaries—to complain? We are grateful, believe me. We are grateful, honestly and truly, because, well, we know how much worse it would be without it. And you, all of you youngsters under 65, are good children, and you are taking care of your papas and mamas. So why should we complain?</p>
<p>Only sometimes, on the third of each month, as we finger that brown envelope, there is a little sorrow in our hearts, because—it's hard to explain—but somehow we feel that it should be different. How different? Well, let's start at the beginning. Take me, for example. So I went to the SS office to apply for my benefits. Tell me, have you ever been to an SS office? No? You haven't? Of course not. You are young. Well, then, have you ever been to an employment office? Looking for a job? During a time of depression, I mean. When there are no jobs. Well, that's what an SS office is like. Those rows of hard chairs. That calling out of numbers. That waiting and waiting and waiting.</p>
<p>Why couldn't you young people arrange it a little different. After all, we are not as young as we used to be. Show a little regard for us. I mean have some upholstered chairs—even used ones would do—and coffee served, and maybe a little music in the background, and maybe the receptionist should be a little less gruff. Why not? Would it cost you much? A little graciousness never hurt anybody. But like this you make us feel like it is the '30s all over again. And why should you rub it in like that? We remember it only too well as it is.</p>
<p>Do I mean to say that we love you youngsters under 65 any less for this? God forbid. How could we! After all, you are our very own offspring. But we must have failed—I mean we must have failed to bring you properly, otherwise you'd show a little more delicacy and just a bit more regard for our feelings. For it's the little things that count.</p>
<p>Take for instance those brown envelopes in which you send us our monthly pittance. Nobody will persuade me that the color wasn't chosen intentionally to make us feel even more depressed than we really feel. It's not a color; it's an insult. Only hard core pornography is mailed in envelopes this color. I mean, why not use some pastel shades to cheer us up. And you could also personalize them a bit. For instance, why not go through your records, and when one of us SS'ers has a birthday, enclose a birthday greeting with the remittance. And the same on Father's Day and Mother's Day and Christmas and Armistice Day and Flag Day. It's little things like this that count; they add up. You do these things in your commercial and personal dealings, but where we, elderly people, are concerned it's the same ugly brown envelope month in and month out. Don't you think we have feelings that you treat us this way?</p>
<p>That's it. You think we have no feelings whatsoever, and you don't hide your hostility. We loom big in your eyes. You begrudge us every mouthful of food we buy with the measly remittances you send us. They are eating us out of house and home, you yell. I have heard it myself over the radio. One youngster, a senator or something like that, threatened that by 1985 all Social Security funds will be used up because we SS'ers' gobble up so much. And another, a congressman I think, went him one better and said: no, not by 1985 but by 1981. And a third one, an alderman or sheriff or something like that says: not by 1981 but by 1979. And so it goes on and on. One would think you'd all be rich if it weren't for us.</p>
<p>I am sorry. Many a time I look at that ugly brown envelope and my eyes become filmed with tears and I see it as a kind of palimpsest. Here it is, all covered with print. You pretend to worry about us; you want us to let you know right away in case we move. You instruct the mailman to let you know at once if we change residence. You pretend to be concerned lest a check fail to reach us. But underneath all that outpouring of what looks like concern I seem to detect another inscription: Drop Dead, Already.</p>
<p>You think I exaggerate? Well, maybe a little. You not only grudge us our pitiful allotment, you also mock us. Want to know how? Well, this way: there is that bank—I forget its name—and maybe 10 times a day it keeps harping over the radio that I and other SS'ers should arrange to have our Social Security checks sent directly to it and they would be put into savings accounts. They don't even want us to see the miserable checks and to hold them briefly in our arthritic fingers. Why. . .why even Dagwood is allowed by Blondie to at least look at his weekly check before kissing it good-bye. Savings! What does that smart banker think we do with our allotments? Stash them away in the mattress? Doesn't he know that, except maybe in a short month like February when it isn't a leap year, a check doesn't last the month?</p>
<p>Well, this mockery corning on top of everything else made me mad and I decided to do something about it. So Monday morning, bright and early, nine o'clock on the nose, I called the bank. I want to talk to the president, 1 shouted. What about? a girl asked and I could tell by her voice that she was a dropout from something or other. About my Social Security, I told her. You want to arrange to have it deposited to your account? she wanted to know. Look, honey, I said, you connect me with the president of your bank and I'll explain it all to him.</p>
<p>She didn't answer, but I heard some muttering in the background, and then—then there was the dialtone. They cut me off. They actually dared to cut me off, me a senior citizen who had worked hard and honestly all his life and. . .and. . . .</p>
<p>No. This, they couldn't do to me. This, they wouldn't get away with. So I dashed down the three flights of stairs—well, not exact dashed. . .we SS'ers, our dashing days are over—and I hurried to the bank.</p>
<p>I want to see the president, I announced in no uncertain terms.</p>
<p>They saw right away who they had to deal with, that they couldn't put me off with alibis, so they took me to an office, and there was the president, or the manager, or somebody. A big shot, anyway. And I explained it all to him; told him what was on my mind and how he was mocking us SS'ers.</p>
<p>He only smiled. Here, he says, let me show you how it's all for your benefit. You put your SS allotment in a savings account and it earns interest for you, it works for you, and all you have to do is stand by, I mean sit by, and watch it grow.</p>
<p>And what will I use for food and rent and all the rest of it?</p>
<p>Why, we'll give you a loan, he said. At low interest. Not as low as we pay you, but low.</p>
<p>Well, he was a smart kid, and only in his 40s, and he got around me. I felt all along that there was something wrong about his arithmetic, but I couldn't put my finger on just what it was. So I ended up by doing as he suggested. He was satisfied and I was glad to please him. He promised to send me the loan money in a day or so, after they checked my references.</p>
<p>As I walked out of the bank, a young fellow—hardly more than a boy, maybe 15 or 16 years old—who had been leaning against the wall, detached himself and joined me. He poked something in my back; I don't know what it was, it felt like his index finger, and I guess he hadn't pared his nails in a long time, and muttered: give me your wallet and shut up. So I did. I only had a couple of dollars and my Medicare card in it—it was the end of the month. And also it might not have been his index finger after all. Besides, he looked disadvantaged. But as he rapidly walked away, I muttered under my breath: just you wait another 50 years or so and you'll know how it feels.</p>
<p>Yes, we get old and our habits change. Take me for instance. I always like to read the papers. When I was young I read the news mostly. Then, later, it was the editorials, nice meaty discussions. But since I became an SS'er, it's the obit page that I turn to first. You can learn a lot from the obit page. I have discovered some very interesting facts. For instance, that the late 60s and 70s are killers. Stay way from them if you possibly can. Go into hiding. Move out of town. But if you succeed in reaching the 80s, you are pretty safe. And if, with luck, you get into the 90s, you are practically immortal. Why, weeks sometimes pass without the report of a person in his 90s dying. Yes, and those who survive the 90s almost never die, with very few exceptions. Well, there was one case recently of a man who died at the age of 103, but he had been a movie mogul. And that holds out hope for us, for we SS'ers always disdained movie moguls and the very thought of being one was repugnant to us.</p>
<p>So all we SS'ers have to do is sort of hold our breath and pull through out 60s and 70s. But for someone like me, who still has a baker's dozen to go before reaching the lucky state, it's difficult. For that matter, it's hard for all of us SS'ers. What, in the end, have we to look forward to? A slippery sidewalk, a bad fall, a broken hip followed by pneumonia, and that's that. Kaput.</p>
<p>But that can't be the end. There must be something more.</p>
<p>I will have you know that we SS'ers perform many useful functions and are essential to the ongoing life style. I will not dwell on our past, nor point out what is well known: that we were solid citizens, we paid our taxes, we stopped for red lights and, in season, we praised the Lord and passed the ammunition. But even how we make the scene livable just by being here. Can you imagine what a city like New York would be like if everybody were under 65? Unlivable—that's what it would be. Instead of old people getting so many many more younger people would be victimized. You wouldn't like that, would you? We sort of temper the social climate.</p>
<p>And we also help you financially. Again I see you: smiling condescendingly. I can just hear you saying to yourselves: here we give these SS'ers tax-free handouts every month from our hard-earned earn­ings, and they claim to help us. Well, smile if it pleases you. We like to see you smile. You are our children, after all. But has it occurred to you what a big share of our allotments we give right back to you in: the form of doctors' fees, surgeons' fees, and all those-bottled goods we buy from the drug stores. Silly children that you are, do you really think we believe you can do us any good? But we go to all these doctors and dentists and drug stores anyway. Why not? We put them through college and now we don't want to see them sitting idly in their offices and drug stores, twiddling their thumbs or working crossword puzzles. They might feel neglected, or even rejected, by us, and that wouldn't be good for them. So don't be surprised if we really don't take them very seriously. So what if the doctor says: here, take these three times a day. We smile and say: yes, yes. And next time around when we come to see him again, we assure him that we followed his instructions exactly. You have to be indulgent with children, especially when they are your own.</p>
<p>But we do much more than that for you youngsters under 65. We die for you.</p>
<p>You are not smiling now. I see that now you are indignant. But as soon as I explain it to you you will see for yourselves how right I am.</p>
<p>Has it occurred to you that most of the dying in this country is being done by people on Social Security Yes, this is so. You can check the statistics yourselves. Out of every thousand people in this country about 13 die every year, and of these 13 at least 10 are on SS. Now where would you be without us SS'ers? For if 13 out of every thousand must die every year, someone must do it. If we didn't do the dying, I'll let you guess who would.</p>
<p>Well, we don't want or expect gratitude for this. But a little appreciation would be in order. You don't begrudge special benefits for vets. And it is only right that you shouldn't. You send them to college. But why can't you show a little understanding for our sacrifices, that we lay down our lives in order to meet the statistical requirements of 13 deaths for every thousand of population? And you can't fool around with statistics. You know that.</p>
<p>Only the other day a friend of mine, also on SS, complained to me bitterly on a very delicate subject. I didn't think I'd mention it here, but what the hell, as long as I am being frank let me be totally frank. I am of course referring to s-x. It's a problem. Just because we are 65 and over doesn't mean it's not a problem. And what can we do about it? Rather, what do you youngsters under 65 allow us to do about it? Figure it out for yourselves: a man gets an SS allotment of, say, $186.34—this after the recent increase of six percent granted us by Congress. Now, let's be realistic. At $20 a throw you can't go very far on this. I realize that this is the going rate in Utah where, because of transportation costs and that polygamy business, there may be a buyers' market. But even so, even assuming that s-x is cheaper in other parts of the country, one still can't go far when one is on SS.</p>
<p>Sure, I can just hear you muttering: well, become congressmen. Then you may have the use of the secretarial pool and the government will foot the bill.</p>
<p>But now you are mocking us again. For to become a congressman one first has to run for Congress, and you know very well that past 65 running is not our strong point. I was following the recent Olympics in Montreal and not a single SS'er got as much as an honorable mention. Of course, it may have been discrimination pure and simple. All the same, please don't ask us to run for anything.</p>
<p>Yes, we are like you in every respect, and it's only right you should realize it. For instance, you have your dirty words and we have ours. We SS'ers keep our conversation clean when talking to you, and you should do the same for us. But you don't. I was just now speaking of Congress, and that reminded me of an unpleasant little incident that happened to me recently. It was election time, and one young whippersnapper—50sh, maybe 55—tried to collar the over-65 vote in my neighborhood and held a meeting inviting all senior citizens to come listen to him. I went. Why not? What else have we SS'ers to do? He was running for something, I can't recall what. Well, he started his speech and it was intolerable. It was all about grave problems and grave issues and grave consequences. People near me fidgeted uncomfortably and me—my flash point is not very high, so I got up and appealed to chairman to call the young man, the speaker I mean, to order. There were maybe 60 or 70 of us SS'ers in the audience and he had no right to insult us that way. It was positively cruel.</p>
<p>The young man listened to my protest and didn't turn a hair. I don't think he even understood why I was protesting. Well, he said just as cool as can be: would it please you better if I talked of burning issues or burning problems?</p>
<p>Without knowing it, he touched on a sore spot, for only some weeks before that a young lady addressed our Golden Age Club and urged us to insert a clause in our wills asking that we be cremated if and when the time comes. She appealed to us on-grounds of ecology. We are taking up too much of the shrinking green space with all our dying, she said. That meeting broke up in an uproar, for this you must know that if there is anything we SS'ers dread more than dying it's being burned after we die—it's a kind of combination of claustrophobia and fear of fire.</p>
<p>So I shouted to the young man: don't you threaten me with burning. St. Paul already settled that point.</p>
<p>Well, what about the Apostle St. Paul? he wanted to know. He declared long ago, loud and clear, I said, that it's better to bury than to burn. The candidate looked blank, so I and a few others walked out. We were not going to tolerate that kind of taunting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, we have our own code words and you young people ought to be more careful when talking to us. Take even such a simple word as parlor. To you it has all kinds of pleasant associations, and once upon a time it did also for us, but now it is better not to mention it in our presence. To you a parlor automatically suggests a beauty parlor, or a massage parlor, or just any ordinary parlor. But we hear it and shudder, for the first thing it suggests to us is a fu----l parlor—it is difficult for one of us SS'ers even to pronounce it or to spell it out.</p>
<p>And once about a year ago a proposed organization of SS'ers died aborning on account of a word. We met, a group of us, and in the bitterness of our hearts decided to form an organization to fight for our rights, and mainly to resist the slanders directed against us for no reason at all. And then one man who had been quite a militant in his younger years became overwrought and suggested that what we needed is a real underground. He had hardly uttered the word when a deep hush fell on the group. Nobody blamed the poor man, but not another word was said about organizing, and we dispersed.</p>
<p>Of course, I know there already exists an organiza­tion. Gray Panthers, they call themselves. Well, God bless them. I am sure they mean well. But gray is not what our problem is about, and panthers are naturally black while we are mostly white or bald. Now, who on this earth would be scared of a bald panther?</p>
<p>And, oh yes, I was just now talking about elections. I didn't vote this time, even though it's the Bicentennial year. Who was there to vote for? Now, if Norman Thomas had been on the ballot. . .you can bet your life I'd have voted. I'd crawl on all fours to the polling place. But as it is. . . .</p>
<p>Ah, the good old '30s. I used to run to vote for Norman Thomas, meanwhile praying in my heart that FDR would get elected. It felt grand, and FDR didn't disappoint, either, and got elected again and again and again. We used to sing a song that went like this: Yes Siree, Yes Siree, Franklin D, Franklin D.</p>
<p>What should we sing now? Yes Siree, Jimmy C?</p>
<p>No. I’d rather hang my harp on the nearest willow tree.</p>
